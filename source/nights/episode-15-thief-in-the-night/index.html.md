Word up brethren.

Your buddy Mitch here,

I'm back in the arms of London, and I find out 3 of my Yachts have been taken from the club, a tasty blonde (whom I'm willing to share) has led me to believe the solicitor is the proprietor of the Porterhouse in Covent Garden.

I'm proposing a long probed attack, and I will arrange for a seating area in which to conduct our stake out under the moniker of 'Randy McManahue', or the initials RMM.

The agreed date for this rendezvous is Wednesday 1st April (that will fool her).

You will need the following reconnaissance:

04/01/2009 6:00pm  
21-22 Maiden Lane, London  
WC2E 7NA
