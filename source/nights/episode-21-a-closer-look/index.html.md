[Chris Lowis](http://twitter.com/chrislowis/) is our host for the latest in our (admittedly irregular) social meetups.  His [announcement to the list](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2012-February/007036.html) is well worth a read, but the gist is:

Where: [The Sun Inn in Bethnal Green](http://fancyapint.com/Pub/5364) [http://www.suninnbethnalgreen.co.uk/](http://www.suninnbethnalgreen.co.uk/)
When: Tuesday 6th March, 2012
Time: 6.30pm

Let us know if you might be coming via [the Lanyrd event](http://lanyrd.com/2012/lrug-nights-march/).
