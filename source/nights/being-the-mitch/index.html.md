Congratulations on becoming the "Mitch" for the next episode of [LRUG Nights](/nights).  Here's a handy checklist of what you need to do:

1. Change the password, so you are the only Mitch
2. Nights have the title of the corresponding episode of [Baywatch Nights](http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/show/468/episode_listings.html?tag=subtabs;list).  Remember to use the correct title in all communications
3. Choose a date, perhaps via [the mailing list](/mailing-list) or [IRC](/irc).  Tips:
   * roughly halfway between normal [meetings](/meetings) is good
   * check [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/) for clashes with other geek nights
   * the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, choose the night the majority can make
4. Choose a pub, when doing so try to:
   * avoid those that have hosted previous [nights](/nights)
   * choose something central, or at the very least, close to a tube station
   * pick something with plenty of space, ideally where we can score a table
5. Create a new page describing the night on lrug.org.
   * Log in, and click "add child" next to the "Nights" archive page.
   * Change the page filter to "Markdown", if that's how you like to roll.
   * A link to the pub is helpful ([fancy a pint](http://fancyapint.com/) over [b.i.t.e.](http://beerintheevening.com/) if possible).
   * A hastily created google map can be fun.
   * A link to the Baywatch Nights episode is traditional, so that people know what to talk about ([here's the list](http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/show/468/episode_listings.html?tag=subtabs;list))
   * Remember to change the page status at the bottom from "Draft" to "Published" when you're done.
6. Create an [lanyrd](http://lanyrd.com/) event so people can online calendar, as is their wont.
   * Add a link to the event on the lrug.org page you created.
   * Tell [http://twitter.com/hlame/](h-lame) about it so it can be added to [the LRUG series](http://lanyrd.com/series/lrug/)
7. Email the [mailing list](/mailing-list) to let people know about it
   * Email other interested parties too: [ruby-talk](http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/), [rails-talk](http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk), etc...
8. Turn up on the night and have fun. *THIS IS IMPORTANT*.
9. Finally, and _most importantly_: on the night, find someone who is willing and committed to carry the mantle of the "Mitch" for the next meeting.
   * Email them the link to [edit this page](http://lrug.org/admin/pages/edit/46) and the password you created, so that they can do all this for the next episode.

We hope you enjoy your brief moment in the sunshine.
