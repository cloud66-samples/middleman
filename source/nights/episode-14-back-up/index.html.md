Hi guys, Mitch here. I'm back in London town and I need your help.

Eddie Kramer's been blamed for a death, and he's come to me to help exonerate him. Garner and Ryan are on a stakeout, which means that I need some partners for backup. I'm counting on you.

I'm going to be at The Chandos, near Lie-sester Square, next Wednesday night from around 6pm.
