A geisha girl is kidnapped and her small daughter sought by the kidnappers. Mitch and the child's grandfather protect her and attempt to rescue her mom.

I say we take the kid and her gramps and hole up in the pub.  They'll never find us there.

Meet at "The Old Red Lion Theatre" in Angel at 6pm, Thursday 4nd June and we'll lay low for the evening with the aid of some beers.
