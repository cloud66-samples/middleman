Episode 10 of LRUG Nights will take place at the ["The Cock Tavern"](http://www.fancyapint.com/pubs/pub848.html), Fitzrovia on Wednesday August 27th at 6:30pm.

Come along for the usual mix of chat and beer. Mitch will be incognito, [look for the 'woman' drinking beer at the bar](http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/kind-of-a-drag/episode/41750/summary.html).
