Welcome to the first ever [LRUG](http://lrug.org/) podcast!

At the <a href="http://lrug.org/meetings/2010/02/19/march-2010-meeting/">March meeting</a> <a href="http://www.edendevelopment.co.uk">Chris Parsons from Eden Development</a> and <a href="http://www.coreyhaines.com/">Software Journeyman Corey Haines</a> gave talks on software craftsmanship, what it means to Rubyists and how to continuously improve in your craft. 

After their talks (videos available from our meeting hosts <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/software-craftsmanship">Skills Matter</a>), <a href="http://blog.chrislowis.co.uk/">Chris Lowis</a> sat down with Corey and Chris to find out what it means to be a Software Craftsman.
