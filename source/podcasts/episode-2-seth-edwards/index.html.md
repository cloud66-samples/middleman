In this episode I was joined by <a href="http://codesnotdead.blogspot.com">Seth Edwards</a>. Seth is a software developer who works with C# and Ruby and contributes to the <a href="http://github.com/samus/mongodb-csharp">C# bindings for MongoDB</a>. 

Seth gave a talk to LRUG about MongoDB and in this interview we talk some more about that, and also what Ruby developers can learn from C# and vice-versa. You can <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/seth-edwards-mongodb">watch Seth's talk</a> over on the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com">Skills Matter</a> website.
