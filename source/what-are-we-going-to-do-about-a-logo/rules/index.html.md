3. Voting Starts immediately after. **Voting has ENDED**
   1. Votes via email to [the mailing list](/mailing-list) or [me](mailto:murray.steele@gmail.com) directly (I can't be arsed setting up a gameable online poll and trying to police it).
   2. It's not a secret ballot.  Your names will be attached to the logo you vote for.
   3. To avoid ambiguity, votes should include the full url (from [this page](http://lrug.org/what-are-we-going-to-do-about-a-logo)) for the one you like. (no "I vote for the red one that Dave did" votes will be counted).
   4. You have _**1**_ vote.  Use it wisely.

5. Winner announced ~6:30pm Monday night at the [April 2008 meeting](http://lrug.org/meetings/2008/03/16/april-2008-meeting/).  Kudos to be distributed shortly afterwards. **Winner Announced**
6. I'm going to be a dick about people who don't stick to these rules.  There is no common sense in democracy.
7. We NEVER talk of this again.
