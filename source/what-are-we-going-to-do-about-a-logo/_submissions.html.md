Logo submissions, which have mostly been culled from these mailing list threads: [one](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2006-November/000663.html), [two](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2008-April/002232.html) [three](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2008-April/002240.html) and [four](http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2008-April/002250.html)

### James Adam
* ![The original][1]
  The original logo, done as a joke, but it's the closest to an official logo as it was used at the 
  [LRUG pub quiz](http://lrug.org/meetings/2006/12/07/january-2007-pub-quiz-meeting/) 
  and on the flyer for the [LRUG RailsConf London party](http://lrug.org/meetings/2006/09/08/lrug-railsconf-party/).
  Most other logos have used the basic idea as inspiration (e.g. a London skyline inside a Ruby gem).

* ![Tweaked version of Paul Battley's logos][2]
  Actually a tweak of one of Paul Battley's logos shown below.  Also blessed with a modicum of official-ness as it's 
  currently in use on the [LRUG WWR page](http://www.workingwithrails.com/group/3831-london-ruby-users-group).

### Paul Battley
* ![Version 1][3]
  Also [available in SVG][7] 
* ![Version 2][4]
  Also [available in SVG][8] 
* ![Version 3][5] and ![Version 3 in mono][6]
  Also [available in SVG][9] 

### Richard Livsey
* ![based on the old Ruby lang logo][10]
  Richard attempted to redesign the LRUG site and this logo was his attempt to bring LRUG closer to the then current Ruby logo.
  This logo is another with a smell of official-ness wafting around it as it's currently in use as the Logo on the 
  [LRUG Last.fm group](http://www.last.fm/group/LRUG).

### Skills Matter
* ![Something new][11]
  [Skills Matter](http://skillsmatter.com/) are our hosts for our [meetings](/meetings) and they offered 
  us this logo and this has sparked the debate once again.

### Murray Steele
* ![Based on the Baywatch Nights logo][12]
  We have a [spin-off meeting](/nights/), which has it's own logo.  Can the main group logo reflect this 
  logo somehow, so that in some sort of bizarre reversal of the natural order of things the spin-off 
  influences the mainstream? (Also [available in SVG][13]).

### Andrew Stewart
* ![TfL won't like this][14]
  Of course, London has more icons than just a skyline.  It's likely however TfL would destroy us in a 
  legal sense if we used this.  However, can the basic idea of the TfL roundel be used to make something
  less obviously derivative?

### Mike Thomas
* ![Oooh, reverse video][15] and ![... this time with just the text][16]
  With or without ruby gems from Mike.

### Matt Preston
* ![lrug with no r][17] and ![lrug with an r in the gem][18]
  Two variations on a theme from Matt.
  
### Chris Parsons
* ![It's ironical][19]
  Jason Lee also submitted a similar idea, but he didn't collect it into a single image for hosting.  So I'm crediting Chris.

### Andrew McDonough
* ![It's what we're all thinking anyway][20]
  This is probably what normal people think when they hear LRUG pronounced.  James Adam
  has altered this to create his own version, which you can see [here][21], but we're giving 
  the credit to Andrew McDonough for doing all the heavy lifting.

### Murray Steele (take 2)
* ![A river runs through it][22]
  Based on thinking about what other icons London has (after Andrew Stewart's TfL inspired version), we have the Thames 
  river.  The execution is poor, but there might be some merit to the idea in the hands of a more skilled _artiste_. 
  Also available as [svg][23].

### Paul Battley (again)
* ![I'll punch you right in the jacket][24]
  A slightly more aggressive logo this time round, from one man logo machine, Paul Battley.  

### Michael Burnham
* ![a logo][25] and ![a street sign][26]
  Nicely inspired by London, although why it's EC1 is <strike>baffling to me</strike> quite clear to me now: our usual venue is in EC1.
  
### Jonathan Lim
* ![Vertical][27]
  A vertical choice from Jon.
