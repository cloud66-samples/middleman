    <h3><a href="/nights/episode-20-rendezvous/">Episode #20: Rendezvous</a></h3>
    <p>Episode 20 of LRUG Nights will take place on Tuesday, March 30th 2010.</p>

<p>The week after the <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish Ruby Conference</a> there'll be a few visiting rubyists coming through London on their way home.  A few of them have got in touch and so we've arranged a special LRUG Nights to meet up with them.  We'll be spending the night in <a href="http://harrisonbar.co.uk/">The Harrison Bar</a>, starting at 6:30pm.</p>

<p>Come along if you want to say hi and get the low-down of the conference if you missed it, or continue the conference socializing if you did go.  Mitch might even make an appearance if he get's done <a href="http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/rendezvous/episode/41760/summary.html?tag=ep_guide;summary">dealing with an embezzling wife and her murderous husband</a>.</p>
