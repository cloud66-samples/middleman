    <h3><a href="/nights/being-the-mitch/">Being The "Mitch"</a></h3>
    <p>Congratulations on becoming the "Mitch" for the next episode of <a href="/nights">LRUG Nights</a>.  Here's a handy checklist of what you need to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Change the password, so you are the only Mitch</li>
  <li>Nights have the title of the corresponding episode of <a href="http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/show/468/episode_listings.html?tag=subtabs;list">Baywatch Nights</a>.  Remember to use the correct title in all communications</li>
  <li>Choose a date, perhaps via <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> or <a href="/irc">IRC</a>.  Tips:
    <ul>
      <li>roughly halfway between normal <a href="/meetings">meetings</a> is good</li>
      <li>check <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">lanyrd</a> for clashes with other geek nights</li>
      <li>the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, choose the night the majority can make</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Choose a pub, when doing so try to:
    <ul>
      <li>avoid those that have hosted previous <a href="/nights">nights</a></li>
      <li>choose something central, or at the very least, close to a tube station</li>
      <li>pick something with plenty of space, ideally where we can score a table</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create a new page describing the night on lrug.org.
    <ul>
      <li>Log in, and click "add child" next to the "Nights" archive page.</li>
      <li>Change the page filter to "Markdown", if that's how you like to roll.</li>
      <li>A link to the pub is helpful (<a href="http://fancyapint.com/">fancy a pint</a> over <a href="http://beerintheevening.com/">b.i.t.e.</a> if possible).</li>
      <li>A hastily created google map can be fun.</li>
      <li>A link to the Baywatch Nights episode is traditional, so that people know what to talk about (<a href="http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/show/468/episode_listings.html?tag=subtabs;list">here's the list</a>)</li>
      <li>Remember to change the page status at the bottom from "Draft" to "Published" when you're done.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Create an <a href="http://lanyrd.com/">lanyrd</a> event so people can online calendar, as is their wont.
    <ul>
      <li>Add a link to the event on the lrug.org page you created.</li>
      <li>Tell <a href="h-lame">http://twitter.com/hlame/</a> about it so it can be added to <a href="http://lanyrd.com/series/lrug/">the LRUG series</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Email the <a href="/mailing-list">mailing list</a> to let people know about it
    <ul>
      <li>Email other interested parties too: <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/community/mailing-lists/">ruby-talk</a>, <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/rubyonrails-talk">rails-talk</a>, etcâ€¦</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Turn up on the night and have fun. <em>THIS IS IMPORTANT</em>.</li>
  <li>Finally, and <em>most importantly</em>: on the night, find someone who is willing and committed to carry the mantle of the "Mitch" for the next meeting.
    <ul>
      <li>Email them the link to <a href="http://lrug.org/admin/pages/edit/46">edit this page</a> and the password you created, so that they can do all this for the next episode.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>We hope you enjoy your brief moment in the sunshine.</p>

        <p><a href="/nights/">LRUG Nights</a> are semi-regular pub meet-ups that float around different venues.  You should watch <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> for details.  Each episode is organised by "Mitch", but if you come along he might ask you to help out with the next one.</p>
