    <h3><a href="/nights/episode-19-epilogue/">Episode #19: Epilogue</a></h3>
    <p>Episode 19 of LRUG Nights will take place on Wednesday January 6th 2010.</p>

<p>Our normal meetings will be changing venue starting with the January meeting, and so we need to find a new post-meeting pub.  This extra-special LRUG Nights is tasked with that mission.  We'll start at 6:30pm in our old drinking den <a href="http://www.fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.php">The Crown</a> to say goodbye to it, and then it's off to the areas surrounding our new venue to seek out a replacement.  Chances are we'll checkout a few of the pubs in these areas:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.fancyapint.com/area/00055.php">Clerkenwell</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://www.fancyapint.com/area/00058.php">Barbican</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Come along if you want to help our mission (and indulge in some ruby chat). Mitch won't be there as he's <a href="http://www.tv.com/baywatch-nights/epilogue/episode/41759/summary.html?tag=ep_guide;summary">dealing with some step-father based murder investigation</a>.</p>

        <p><a href="/nights/">LRUG Nights</a> are semi-regular pub meet-ups that float around different venues.  You should watch <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> for details.  Each episode is organised by "Mitch", but if you come along he might ask you to help out with the next one.</p>
