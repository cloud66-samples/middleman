      <h1>LRUG Nights</h1>
      <div id="about" class="content">
  <p><strong>Sometimes it's nice to forget about learning.</strong> Sometimes it's nice to meet folk without having a predefined agenda.  Sometimes it's nice to drink beers. Sometimes it's nice to solve crimes in the seedy LA underworld. <em>But most of the time it's just nice to drink beers.</em></p>
  <p>Welcome to <a href="/">LRUG</a> Nights.</p>
  <p>A monthly meetup, roughly halfway between our <a href="/meetings/">regular meetings</a>, where we chat, drink beers, maybe solve crimes.</p>

        <p><a href="/nights/">LRUG Nights</a> are semi-regular pub meet-ups that float around different venues.  You should watch <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> for details.  Each episode is organised by "Mitch", but if you come along he might ask you to help out with the next one.</p>
