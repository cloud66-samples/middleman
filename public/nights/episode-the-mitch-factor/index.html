    <p>So rumour has it that Mitch Buchannon is still on the run but due to technical 
difficulties he is stuck in a pub located somewhere in London.</p>

<p>We've used the latest tracking technology and reckon the <a href="http://tinyurl.com/38wwsjc">Mitre</a> is
where he will be hiding. Sources suggest that he will be in 
the premises on Tuesday (tonight) 24th August from 6.30pm. 
Hopefully see you there!</p>

        <p><a href="/nights/">LRUG Nights</a> are semi-regular pub meet-ups that float around different venues.  You should watch <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> for details.  Each episode is organised by "Mitch", but if you come along he might ask you to help out with the next one.</p>
