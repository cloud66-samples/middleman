<p>This month, we have decided to offer something different: a pub quiz about Ruby,
Ruby on Rails, and more.</p>

<h3 id="january-2022-meeting--lrug-pub-quiz">LRUG Pub quiz <a href="#january-2022-meeting--lrug-pub-quiz" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Are you proud of your knowledge of Ruby and Ruby on Rails? Invite your
friends, and win bragging rights. Or simply invite them and enjoy spending
time with them.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The quiz will have 4 categories, and each category will have between 20 and 30
questions. The 4 categories are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Ruby</li>
  <li>Ruby on Rails</li>
  <li>General computing</li>
  <li>London</li>

<p>It's been nearly 2 years of this and we still haven't worked out a good
replacement for hanging out in the pub after the meeting. That said we
leave the zoom call running for a little while after the talks for
folk to chat. We encourage the speakers to hang around too if they can,
so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the meeting, or
that you felt were too niche to share with the wider group. If you've got

  <p>As services start to split off from your majestic monolith, cascading
failures as a single service or endpoint slows down can become a
recurring problem which very quickly can lead to service unavailability.
Implementing load-shedding and deadline propagation across your services
is a technique which can help you provide a more resilient service to
your customers. This talk will introduce some of the concepts explored
in <a href="https://github.com/CGA1123/loadshedding-experiment-ruby">CGA1123/loadshedding-experiment-ruby</a>

early stage of his new startup, LollipopAI, and how Rails gave them
quick experiments, good-enough domain modelling and tooling that just
works.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Language servers like <a href="https://solargraph.org">Solargraph</a> can give code
editing superpowers to your favourite editor (Emacs, Vim, VSCode, etc.).
I'll talk about the Language Server Protocol and its advantages over
editor-specific plugins, as well as how Solargraph learns about your
Ruby. I'll also talk about the challenges that Rails poses for such
tooling and how solargraph-rails attempts to overcome them.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tdeo">Thierry Deo</a> co-founder and lead dev at
<a href="https://www.pennylane.com">Pennylane</a> is going to tell us all about
optimising their postgresql db:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's often considered best practice to normalize the database structure
to avoid data redundancy and incoherence. In Pennylane's accounting
platform we've found that this actually does not always help with data
coherence, and even introduces additional complexity in managing data
access. Our combination of denormalizing some of our data, enhancing
some of ActiveRecord's methods, and introducing default behaviors in our
application models has enabled us to greatly simplify access control
management and given us confidence that our production data is in a
consistent state.</p>

<p>We do our best to keep the zoom call open for a while after the talks for
those attendees that want to chat for a bit afterwards. It lacks the
general cacophonous ambiance of a pub, and you'll have to bring your own
drinks and chips, but it's better than nothing. The speakers may be
available so you can ask them questions you weren't able to during the
meeting, or that you felt were too niche to share with the wider group.

  <p>The June 2021 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Wednesday the 9th of June</em>, from… wait, what? <strong>Wednesday</strong>?!</p>

<p>Yes, that's right. This month, we’re doing something a <strong>little different</strong> and joining up with many of the other European Ruby user groups (including our good friends in <a href="https://nwrug.org">NWRug</a>, <a href="https://shrug.org">Shrug</a>, <a href="https://www.meetup.com/south-west-ruby/">SW Ruby</a> and <a href="https://scotrug.org">ScotRuby</a>) to have a sort-of mini Rails-Conf.</p>

<p>The details are now available at <a href="https://www.emeaonrails.com">the EMEA on Rails site</a> and we will keep you updated as we find out more about how to join in on the day. You can also <a href="https://twitter.com/emeaonrails">follow the event on Twitter</a>. The event will run through the afternoon and early evening (the schedule showing <code>GMT + 1</code> is the same as <code>BST</code>, our current timezone), and you'll be free to dip in and out as your own schedule allows.</p>

<p>This is all a bit of an experiment, but hopefully it will be a fun opportunity to interact with some other user groups, and take a little bit more advantage of the remote-ness of our circumstances at the moment. In July, we'll be back to our regular second-Monday meetups.</p>

<p>Hopefully see you then!</p>

<p><a href="https://binarysolo.chapter24.blog">Ayush Newatia</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You may have heard that cookie security is hard with the need to worry
special flags and encryption. Actually, Ruby on Rails makes it super
simple to securely store data in cookies. In this talk I'll explain the
different types of cookies supported by Rails and what Rails does under
the hood to secure the data they contain.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tom-lord">Tom Lord</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Sometimes a new feature may be objectively worthwhile; but often one
might be left wondering “Does this actually make our product better?”,
or “Is this making the business more money?”.</p>

  <p>In this talk, I will explore the virtues of defining North Star metrics,
AB testing product variations to statistical significance, and using
funnel analysis to quantify a feature's value.</p>

<p>We leave the zoom call running after the talks are over for as long as our
collective rumbling stomachs can handle.  Why not stick around and chat
with the handful of attendees who also don't have zoom fatigue yet. If
you've got any ideas for something better let us know at
<a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#111;&#114;&#103;&#097;&#110;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#108;&#114;&#117;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#111;&#114;&#103;&#097;&#110;&#105;&#115;&#101;&#114;&#115;&#064;&#108;&#114;&#117;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>.</p>
