<p>The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 8th of December, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> have provided their overflow venue <a href="http://www.sessionshouse.com/">The Old Sessions House</a> on <a href="http://tinyurl.com/5qfpkc">Clerkenwell Green</a> for this meeting because of the number of <a href="#dec08registration">registrations</a>.  They still want you to <a href="#dec08registration">register your attendance</a> though, so you can be let into the venue.</p>

<p><a href="http://thechrisoshow.com/">Chris O'Sullivan</a> loves testing, and it's been eating away at him that he can't test the javascript he writes for his rails apps.  In this talk he'll be showing off how he finally worked out how to test this stuff and return to the shores of Testingland.</p>

<p>At the end of all things, one fact will be carved upon the smouldering husk that was once this earth.  That fact shall read:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>After each LRUG meeting, the assembled masses did reconvene at <a href="http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html">The Crown Tavern</a>, 
but a short distance from the original meeting point, and from there did imbibe boozes.  All were welcome,
even those who couldn't make the main talks.  And there was much rejoicing in the tavern."</p>

<p><a href="http://coupde.com/">James Darling</a> has recently been hacking about with the <a href="http://www.shazam.com/music/web/pages/iphone.html">Shazam iPhone app</a> and the <a href="http://www.last.fm/api">Last.fm API</a> in an attempt to scrobble his <a href="http://www.last.fm/user/Abscond/tracks">vinyl listening habits</a>.  Along the way he used a <a href="http://www.goto.info.waseda.ac.jp/~fukusima/ruby/pcap-e.html">ruby packet sniffing tool</a>.  In this short talk he's going to show off the packet sniffer and the end-to-end hack he came up with.</p>

<p>A video of James's talk (actually presented by <a href="http://feedmechocolate.com">Chris Mear</a> due to illness), filmed by <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/packet-sniffing">Skills Matter</a> is available on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-85168513489269464&amp;hl=en">Google Video</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://jasoncale.com/">Jason Cale</a> offered to run a talk / discussion on how to cope with evolving a single project into a maintainable code-base for multiple projects.  That's not a great distilation of his idea, so here are his words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The basic premise of what I have now is a (yet another) custom CMS / E-commerce system that an agency
commissioned me to build ..</p>

  <p>The system serves both flash websites (via restful apis), and a couple of html based ones .. I'm 
currently trying to work out the best way to keep a single code base that can serve present 
development, and future ones .. be flexible and 'hackable' and maintainable .. at the moment 
its a mix of plugins, config files and theme based extensions.</p>

  <p>I certainly don't have all the answers .. but with a bit of research I could present what I've 
come up with so far, other ideas I've come across (most things online I've found just mention
it is hard) and then open it up for discussion.</p>

  <p>At the moment instead of it being 'lessons learned' etc, it would still be very present tense, 
because these problems are ones I'm still working through.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Jason might post on the <a href="/mailing-list">mailing list</a> before the meeting some of his ideas to help stimulate the discussion part of his talk.  So if you are intersted make sure you watch out for his mails.</p>

<p>A video of Jasons talk, filmed by <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/one-code-base-many-projects">Skills Matter</a> is available on <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5376247944588981030&amp;hl=en">Google Video</a>.</p>

  <li>James has had to pull out due to a double booking.  Stay tuned for a replacement.*</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://imaj.es/">James Cox</a> says this about his talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As part of my anti-hermitization, I'll be swinging by LRUG for possibly the first time to 
show off <a href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/starling/">starling</a> and why it's cool. Starling was a
project born from trying to manage message queues using <a href="http://www.danga.com/memcached/">memcached</a>. 
I'll try and explain how it came about, show how it works and figure out some ways it could be 
used productively.</p>

<p>Ben Hood kindly offered to step in and talk about some work he's been doing with <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> and ruby.  The outline is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Characterize the motivations behind messaging in Ruby applications;</li>
  <li>Touch on the current approaches that have been taken;</li>
  <li>Look at what AMQP offers in general;</li>
  <li>Discuss how this potential can be harnessed in a Rubyesque fashion;</li>
  <li>Elaborate using real example on what has been developed to date and what is currently being worked on.</li>
</ul>

This talk will cover the infrastructure required to handle multi-petabyte, highly scalable systems 
and how we're using Rails to quickly build flexible software to support this effort.</p>

<p><a href="http://infovore.org/">Tom Armitage</a> launched a rails forum site called <a href="http://new-caprica.org/">New Caprica</a> back in March after ~9 months of toil.  In his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the way it's had two rewrites, I've taught myself <a href="http://www.ruby-doc.org/stdlib/libdoc/test/unit/rdoc/classes/Test/Unit.html">Test:Unit</a>, <a href="http://rspec.info/">RSpec</a>,
<a href="http://capify.org/">Capistrano</a>, and a few other things through it, and it currently has
about <a href="http://eigenclass.org/hiki.rb?rcov">74% C0 coverage</a> and a 2:1 Test:Code ratio.</p>

  <p>I'm also pretty exhausted, and now have the joy of wrangling real users.</p>

  <p>Anyhow, I thought there could be something fun in lessons learned, a few
bits of advice I realised on the way, and perhaps a small demo of the
software.</p>

<p><a href="http://blog.kuriositaet.de">Tim Becker</a> popped up on our <a href="/mailing-list">mailing list</a> to offer up a talk about a new meta-programming library called <a href="http://weave.rubyforge.org/">weave</a> that he'd been developing.  In his own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>weave is a library for 'live native monkey patching'. It provides a
native wrapper to the C functions in the MRI Ruby implementation that
are involved in creating native extensions. This allows you to swap
native code in and out at runtime.</p>

<p>Lots of people have probably written code (be it gems, rails plugins, collections of rake tasks or little itch-scratcher scripts) that they're kinda proud of, but don't really want to pad out a 5-10 minute demo / show-off into one of our "traditional" 20-30 minute talks, so we never get to hear about it. As a community we're probably missing out on a lot of sweet ruby goodness because of that.</p>

<p>This month we hope to change that by running a bunch of Show'n'Tell sessions where people show off their code for 5-10 mins.  There's no set idea on what you should show off: perhaps a neat function you're really proud of, perhaps a whole gem, perhaps just some .irbrc hacks that you think are super useful.  Anything goes, as long as it's code.</p>

<p>Exhausted and weary from all the code being thrown around we'll stumble into <a href="http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html">The Crown Tavern</a> to try to make sense of it all.  Here's where we'll hatch master plans to combine all the gems, rake tasks and scripts into a new framework for world domination.  If you're not sure that you'll make it for the main meeting, but don't want to be left out of the LRUG master-plan you should definitely come along to the pub and sign up for a minor bureaucratic position in the New World Order.</p>

  <p>The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 10th of March, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm, in the <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> overflow venue <a href="http://www.sessionshouse.com/">The Old Sessions House</a> on <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;msa=0&amp;ll=51.524058,-0.104628&amp;spn=0.004533,0.007907&amp;z=17&amp;msid=110079876098346406496.000447c8b0590d82aef55">Clerkenwell Green</a>.

<h2 id="march-2008-meeting--agenda">Agenda <a href="#march-2008-meeting--agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>It's entering silly season in the ruby conference year, with <em>9</em> conferences due in March and April (<a href="http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=r6c5vcp8tq92731rfbmm33q1e0%40group.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=Europe/London">according to this calendar</a>).  All the speakers at this meeting are talking at one or more of these conferences.</p>

<h3 id="march-2008-meeting--challenges-in-making-ruby-run-effectively-on-a-jvm">Challenges in making Ruby run effectively on a JVM <a href="#march-2008-meeting--challenges-in-making-ruby-run-effectively-on-a-jvm" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://www.version2.dk/blogs/krestenkrabthorup">Kresten Krab Thorup</a>, track host and speaker at both <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=86">QCon</a> and <a href="http://jaoo.dk/ruby-cph/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=106">RubyFools</a>, will provide an overview of the issues, trade-offs and challenges in making dynamic object-oriented languages run effectively; both in general, and specifically making Ruby run well on the JVM.  Kresten has many years deep knowledge of getting the most out of a JVM, and has recently been working on an research project on building yet another JVM-based virtual machine for Ruby and thus, the talk is organized around issues and findings in building this virtual machine.</p>

<p>A video of this talk, filmed by Skills Matter, is <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=4419988168845761981">available on Google Video</a> or <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/challenges-in-making-ruby-run-effectively-on-a-jvm">the Skills Matter site</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mintdigital.com/">Thomas Pomfret</a> is going to give us a trailer version of his <a href="http://www.scotlandonrails.com/talks#mobileact_a_highrisk_rails_app_for_channel_4">Scotland On Rails talk</a>.  The blurb from the conference website says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>mobileAct Unsigned is Channel 4 TV search for the best unsigned band in Britain. The site lets bands and fans to communicate and 
share media. In addition, users get to vote on who should win the million pound recording deal. "mobileAct: a high-risk Rails app
for Channel 4" will report back on Mint's experiences building this mass-market application. In the light of recent TV voting 
scandals, the spotlight was on voting. In a very public arena, we had to make sure not only that the vote was fair, but that 
it could be seen to be fair.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So we can expect his "trailer" to cover some or all of that.</p>

<h3 id="march-2008-meeting--handling-long-running-tasks-in-rails">Handling Long-Running Tasks in Rails <a href="#march-2008-meeting--handling-long-running-tasks-in-rails" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://blog.airbladesoftware.com/">Andrew Stewart</a> is also talking at <a href="http://www.scotlandonrails.com/talks#handling_longrunning_tasks_in_rails">Scotland On Rails</a> and so as not to be shown up by Thomas's extra preparation is also going to give us a trailer for his talk, described on the conference site as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rails is a web framework and thus designed for HTTP's synchronous request and response: you make a request to the application, 
the application executes it and returns the response. For your application to feel snappy its filters and actions should take 
no more than a few milliseconds to execute. But what do you do if you need to run a task that takes more than a few 
milliseconds? Perhaps ten minutes or even longer? You need to move execution off the request-response thread and onto
a different one.</p>

  <p>Rails doesn't support this out of the box and it's not obvious how to do this correctly. Happily a number of plugins fill 
the gap. They all work differently, though, and cater for different situations. The one you need for your application 
depends on your situation.</p>

  <p>This session lays out all your options and explains where each plugin is best suited. It shows you how to work with each 
plugin. By the end you will be able to make an informed decision about which one you need in any given situation - and how 
to use it well.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We obviously can't expect a "trailer" to cover all the plugins and solutions out there, but it's bound to cover some of them.</p>

<h2 id="march-2008-meeting--pub">Pub <a href="#march-2008-meeting--pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>As usual, we'll head down to <a href="http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html">The Crown Tavern</a> after the "serious" meeting.  There's usually lots of good ruby chat in the pub and it's a great opportunity to try and thrash out those thorny problems with work or personal projects.  If you're not sure that you'll make it for the main meeting, you should definitely come along to the pub and meet up with us there.</p>

<h2 id="mar08registration">Registration <a href="#mar08registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/lrug">Please register with Skills Matter</a> if you are planning to come.  Registration has pretty much become mandatory, as in the past few meetings we've had to close the doors after an influx of registrants over the final weekend, resulting in standing room only.  Skills Matter can book a larger room, but they need much more notice in order to do so.  Please, therefore, <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/lrug">register now</a> rather than later.</p>

<p>There's also an <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/435107/">upcoming event</a> for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.</p>

  <p>The next meeting of LRUG will be on Monday the 11th of February, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm, and we'll be returning to our usual <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> venue at <a href="http://maps.google.co.uk/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;q=EC1R+0BE&amp;layer=&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=16&amp;om=1&amp;iwloc=addr">1 Sekforde St.</a>.</p>

<h3 id="february-2008-meeting--lightning-talks">Lightning Talks <a href="#february-2008-meeting--lightning-talks" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>This month, we're going to have a series of lightning talks from various members of the local ruby community.  To make it even more interesting, all the presentations will follow the 20x20 slide format (also known as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pecha_Kucha">Pecha Kucha</a>).  The presenter has 20 slides which are displayed for 20 seconds each, giving a total presentation time of 6:40.  It should be a fun evening, as with only 6:40 in which to get your point across the presenters will have to be economical with their words, and possibly leave out things like justification or proof for their opinions.</p>

<p>We're aiming to have between 8 and 10 presenters.  Those already confirmed are:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://interblah.net/">James Adam</a> - "Rails is not the only fruit"</li>
  <li><a href="http://livsey.org/">Richard Livsey</a> - RSpec stories.</li>
  <li><a href="http://blog.theyworkforyou.co.nz/">Rob McKinnon</a> - "A Ruby Journey"</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.inter-sections.net/">Daniel Tenner</a> - Adobe Flex: what it is, why he uses it with ruby</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.dafydd.net/">Dafydd Rees</a> - "When shouldn't you use a DSL? and what can you do instead?"</li>
  <li><a href="http://roninonrails.blogspot.com/">David Salgado</a> - Rails deployment platforms</li>
  <li><a href="http://del.icio.us/knaveofdiamonds/">Roland Swingler</a> - Pattern matching in ruby</li>
  <li><a href="http://wildfalcon.com/">Laurie Young</a> - Design patterns in ruby</li>
</ul>

<p>A video of the meeting, filmed by Skills Matter, is <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=2462251012093607863">available on Google Video</a> or on <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/lightning-talks-various-topics">the Skills Matter site</a>.</p>

<h3 id="february-2008-meeting--qcon-ticket-raffle">QCon Ticket Raffle <a href="#february-2008-meeting--qcon-ticket-raffle" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>The kind folk organising the <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/conference/">QCon</a> conference have given us a ticket to raffle off.  Of immediate interest to us would be the <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/conference/">track on ruby</a>, but the rest of the conference seems interesting as well, with topics of interest such as <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=99">agile development</a>, <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=86">new languages</a> and <a href="http://qcon.infoq.com/london/tracks/show_track.jsp?trackOID=83">domain specific languages</a> to name just a couple of the other tracks on offer.  To give away the ticket we'll do the same thing as we've done on past occasions and choose the lucky recipient from the names of the attendees on the night.</p>

<h2 id="february-2008-meeting--pub">Pub <a href="#february-2008-meeting--pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Once the excitement of the slides and ticket raffle have died down, we'll head on over to <a href="http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html">The Crown Tavern</a>.  This pub is only a couple of minutes walk from the Skills Matter offices and so is perfect for a post-meeting chat and drink.  As usual, if you're not sure that you'll make it in time for the main meeting, you are more than welcome to just head along to the pub and meet up with us there.</p>

<h2 id="feb08registration">Registration <a href="#feb08registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/lrug">Please register with Skills Matter</a> if you are planning to come.  They need us to register so they make sure we get the most appropriately sized room, but they can only accommodate a larger than usual meeting (more than 80 folk) if they get enough notice to book a bigger room, so <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com/lrug">register now</a> rather than later.  There's also an <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/415440/">upcoming event</a> for those of us that love online calendaring.</p>

  <p>Due to organisational problems, the proposed January Pub Quiz (we're trying to start a <a href="/meetings/2006/12/07/january-2007-pub-quiz-meeting/">tradition</a>) has been postponed until a later date.  It'll probably be run in March as a special <a href="/nights/">LRUG Nights</a>.</p>

<p>In the interim the January emergency backup meeting is on Monday the 14th of January, from 6:30pm onwards at <a href="http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub1054.html">The Chandos</a> pub in central London.  There's no agenda, other than to mull over the <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org/en/news/2007/12/25/ruby-1-9-0-released/">recent events</a>, <a href="http://www.ruby-forum.com/search?query=ANN&amp;forums%5B%5D=4&amp;forums%5B%5D=3&amp;max_age=1+month">new releases</a> and <a href="http://zedshaw.com/rants/rails_is_a_ghetto.html">gossip</a> from the ruby community over the festive break.</p>

<p>See you all there.</p>
