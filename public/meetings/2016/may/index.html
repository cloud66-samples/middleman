<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jcinnamond">John Cinnamond</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of us do some form of code review, increasingly often through pull
requests. Done well it can be a great tool for improving quality, sharing
knowledge, and building a sense of cohesion in a team. Done badly it can be
toxic. In this talk I’d like to look at the motivations for code review,
examine research into its value, and suggest some practices on how to do it
well.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.thedevopsdoctors.com/">Asfand Yar Qazi</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine some of the worst things that could happen to you during <code>cap deploy</code>
– well, they happened to Ali on the same day, and it turned into one of the
worst days of his life. Interestingly, Sally in the office across the street
had the exact same issues come up during her deployment. However her team had
invested in their infrastructure sensibly, and deployed fresh immutable
server clusters from pre-built machine images on each deploy. She could just
relax, as the infrastructure had been designed to filter out most problems
that could occur during deployment. Here is their story!</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/matthewcford">Matthew Ford</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bit Zesty have been playing with Docker to help with Dev/Prod parity, but
deploying and managing Docker images in production has been a pain. Convox
helps by providing a simple Heroku-esque CLI to deploy and manage your
application on AWS. We've been able to replace a bunch of terraform +
chef/ansible scripts and use Docker in production without the headache.</p>

<p>The nice people at <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a> have provided 5 tickets for <a href="http://brightonruby.com/">Brighton Ruby conference</a>, a one day, single track, conference for Rubyists &amp; the Ruby-curious in Brighton on 8th July.  The tickets were raffled off on our <a href="/mailing-list">mailing list</a> with the winners contacted on Thursdayday 5th May.  Thanks <a href="https://pusher.com/">Pusher</a>!</p>

<p>We should be done with the talks by 8pm at which point have a choice to make:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Stay at Code Node where Skills Matter have a cash bar and you can mingle with attendees of other meetups held that night.</li>
  <li>Head over to <a href="http://singertavern.com/">the Singer Tavern</a> (located at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y 1AG</a>) where you'll find a wide selection of food and drinks to choose from and a bunch of LRUG members to chat with.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you're unable to attend the talks it's more than acceptable to come along to one of these venues to hang out with the rest of the LRUG members.</p>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8095-lrug-may-meetup">register with our hosts Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8095-lrug-may-meetup">register with Skills Matter</a>.</p>

<p>You can also find <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2016/lrug-may/">this meeting on lanyrd</a>, but this is not a meaningful way to tell us you wish to attend.  We mostly use it after the meeting to collect artefacts about the talks like videos, slides, writeups, code, etc.</p>
