  <p>A/B tests are simple: you have a change you want to make; you define what
"conversion" is; you randomly show the change to half your users, and see
if "conversion" goes up or down with the change. But what if the effects
are more complex?</p>

  <p>I'll talk about an experiment we ran that initially targeted a single
measure of conversion but had some knock-on effects, and how we were able
to study them. I'll share some very easy things you can do right away to
get more information out of your A/B tests, and hopefully convince you
there's more to them than deciding on some copy, or the colour of a button.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While Rails provides us a great platform for rapid application development
it doesn't give us much guidance on where to start placing common
abstractions once our domain complexity grows. This talk isn't about the
'architecture astronaut' or fighting rails to implement 'better' patterns,
it's a really basic intro to some of the layers you can implement tomorrow
to compartmentalise your code without having to fight the framework.</p>

  <p>For almost a year I've enjoyed using Docker and docker-compose to work on

have been always been painful. This talk is about exploring the rather
unsatisfactory options available to speed up the process of "development

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jamesjoshuahill">Josh Hill</a> wants to share his experiences with pair-programming:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Josh heard about pair programming a few years ago and tried it a few
times. Last year, he jumped in and started pairing full-time. Working so
closely with clients, colleagues, juniors and seniors was challenging. Now he
enjoys pairing more than flying solo and has seen the benefits for himself
and his teammates. This talk is about the challenges and benefits of working
more closely with one another.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tomclose">Tom Close</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>12 months ago we were facing a number of problems familiar in an early
stage startup:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>a monolithic codebase that had accumulated a lot of technical debt</li>
    <li>a requirement to handle complex business processes that were changing
quickly as the business scaled</li>
    <li>a growing development team struggling to enable new hires to be effective
quickly</li>
  </ul>

  <p>We initially considered moving to a micro-service architecture but eventually
settled on using rails engines to refactor our monolith, allowing us to make
immediate gains in productivity whilst avoiding the operational complexity of
a distributed system. The talk will cover the approach we are taking in this
(ongoing) refactor, the rules we found we needed to play by, and the lessons
we learned along the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most of us do some form of code review, increasingly often through pull
requests. Done well it can be a great tool for improving quality, sharing
knowledge, and building a sense of cohesion in a team. Done badly it can be
toxic. In this talk I’d like to look at the motivations for code review,
examine research into its value, and suggest some practices on how to do it
well.</p>

  <p>Imagine some of the worst things that could happen to you during <code>cap deploy</code>
– well, they happened to Ali on the same day, and it turned into one of the
worst days of his life. Interestingly, Sally in the office across the street
had the exact same issues come up during her deployment. However her team had
invested in their infrastructure sensibly, and deployed fresh immutable
server clusters from pre-built machine images on each deploy. She could just
relax, as the infrastructure had been designed to filter out most problems
that could occur during deployment. Here is their story!</p>

whiteboards for planning? Could we deliver on time for a project if we never
set a deadline? And what happens when half of the development team changes
every two weeks? Come along to our public retrospective on what went well and
what we would never do again.</p>

  <p>Finding the derivative of a mathematical function on a computer can be

that works in Ruby.</p>
