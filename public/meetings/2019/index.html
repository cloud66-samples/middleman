<p>We received the sad news today that Skills Matter has gone into administration and all meet-ups and conferences have been cancelled with immediate effect.</p>

<p>Thankfully our friends at the FT have stepped in last minute to provide a venue. Full details of the event below:</p>

<p>The November 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Monday the 4th of November</em>,
from <em>6:00pm</em> to <em>8:00pm</em> (meeting starts at <em>6:30pm</em>).  The venue, <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/j2S4QxizSZQB33BN8">FT</a> near St Paul's, is
provided by the <a href="https://subs.ft.com/spa3_bc1">FT</a>.  <a href="#nov19registration">Full venue and

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/scottm">Scott Matthewman</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Working with legacy codebases can be tricky at the best of times. What can
make it worse if there’s no consistency in style. Linters (and Ruby’s RuboCop
in particular) can help us write good code going forward – but what about the
code that’s already there? There are good ways, and bad, to get RuboCop to
help.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dmagliola">Daniel Magliola</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adding metrics to your code should effectively have no impact on performance.
When we were recently tasked with doing that in multi-process Ruby servers, we
ran into an interesting challenge: could we aggregate our numbers across
processes without blowing our target of just one microsecond of overhead? In
the process, we found some very counter-intuitive performance results that I'd
like to share with you.</p>

  <p>Using AWS and Google Cloud, we will then dive in to demo and examples to show you how to get started and the true potentials of serverless - plus tons of facts about coconuts Until last year the support for Ruby in the world of FAAS was next to non-existent, now that AWS Lambda has officially started supporting Ruby, I want to catch up any Rubyists who are not yet familiar with the technology, so it can be another tool for the toolbox.</p>

  <p>When I read the tech process literature I feel it's very interesting but it's often about quite a different universe from the world of working on small/tiny tech teams (teams with 1-3 developers/testers/architects/designers). Does that mean that the processes they talk about are only applicable to larger teams? Or maybe that small tech teams don't have the problems that these processes aim to solve. In this talk I want to start to unpick some of this, with the help of 40+ volunteers (thanks for your survey responses).</p>

  <p>Mathematics can make you a better person. Well, not really. It can, 
however, help you think about programming. This talk provides a very quick 
introduction to a branch of mathematics called 'general algebra' and looks
at how it can apply to programming. We then take a real world programming 
challenge and solve it algebraically, then convert that algebraic solution
into working code. By the end you'll be left feeling confused, perhaps a 
little angry, almost certainly a little bored. But without even noticing 
anything has changed you'll soon start to look at difficult software
problems and see past the superficial complexity to get a better 
understanding of the underlying structures at play. And you'll be a better
person for it.</p>

  <p>So often, the biggest bottleneck to scaling is the database. It's also
one of the areas where a little engineering effort goes a long way. 
This talk exists because I think it is very rewarding to write queries
with ActiveRecord that are easily readable and able to scale. We'll 
walk through some real world examples of refactoring some mingin' 
ActiveRecord queries, learn optimisation techniques you can put to work
right away, and build a deeper knowledge of relational databases.</p>

  <p>The January 2019 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Monday the 14th of January</em>,

<h3 id="january-2019-meeting--ruby-golf">Ruby Golf! <a href="#january-2019-meeting--ruby-golf" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>As is tradition, our first meeting of 2019 will be a slightly different kind of thing.  Instead
of talks, we'll be pulling all our not-suitable-for-production Ruby tricks out of the bag and
playing a few rounds of Ruby Golf!</p>

<p>For those unfamiliar with this, put your clubs away: code golfing is where you try to solve a
programming problem using the fewest possible number of characters. Unlike the rest of the time,
we don't care about elegance, we don't care about readability, and we definitely don't care
about performance – make it short, then make it shorter!</p>

<p>Some quick tips to get you going:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Descriptive local variable names? No thanks: <code>a</code>, <code>b</code>, and <code>c</code> will do just fine.</li>
  <li>Why use <code>collect</code> when you can use <code>map</code>?</li>
  <li>You may wish to <code>{</code> brace <code>}</code> yourself, lest you <code>do</code> worse in the <code>end</code>…</li>
</ul>

<h4 id="january-2019-meeting--format">Format <a href="#january-2019-meeting--format" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>

<ul>
  <li>Bring your laptop and a recent Ruby version! Anything 2.2 and up should be fine</li>
  <li>We think this'll be more fun if you work in teams, so you can pool your ideas – chances
are that you know a trick or two that others haven't seen, and vice versa</li>
  <li>We will provide a repository of code which you can clone on the day. This will
contain tests to give you confidence that your solution works, along with some helpers
to count characters fairly across everyone participating</li>
</ul>

<p>There are no official prizes, just bragging rights in the pub afterwards. Speaking of…</p>

<h2 id="january-2019-meeting--afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#january-2019-meeting--afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We aim to finish by 8pm (although it may over-run depending on how much fun we're having!).</p>

<p>If you'd like to socialise with other LRUG attendees afterwards you have two choices:</p>
