<blockquote>
  <p>Good cryptography is hard, but learning the basic concepts don't have to
have to be. By focussing on the key concepts, rather than the exotic maths,
I hope we can initiate more people into understanding what good security
looks like without having to take a University course. For those who already
know their MACs from their IKEs, I hope this talk offers some useful ways
of communicating these concepts to colleagues, friends and family.</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code Node</a>.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a

you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are

  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk

  <p>The OpenPolitics project is a collaborative political policy-writing
platform. Started as an experiment in using open source principles
outside the world of tech, it’s grown into a tool (written in Ruby)
that allows anyone with a good idea to take a direct role in writing
policy. This talk will explain how the project started, how the system
evolved, and how it currently works atop git and GitHub to make open
source workflows democratic and accessible by non-developers.</p>

  <p>Project documentation often falls into a cycle of disrepair: it's
not read because it's not up to date, and not up to date because
nobody reads it. This is a talk about how we tried to break that

<p>The more-structured part of the meeting ends at 8pm, but that doesn't mean your
Ruby-related fun needs to end.  Amidst the near-infinite sea of possibilities
that London offers you, we can recommend winding down the evening and chatting
to other LRUG attendees in either of these locations:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a

you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are

  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk

<blockquote>
  <p>I am a developer who started a web application development consultancy. This
talk is about the story of the business so far, some business basics I had
to learn for the business to survive, and things you can do to better
understand business, whether or not you intend to start one yourself.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Connascence is a useful software quality metric that helps you identify
the types and strengths of coupling within a system. I will show you how to
assess connascence and I'll suggest how using the metric can help you improve
the quality of your code.</p>

<p>We aim to finish up the talks and formal part of the meeting by 8pm, but that
doesn't mean you have to go home.  Even if you are observing a January detox
you can still choose to hang out with other attendees at one of the following
venues:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Code Node.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
hosing on the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y
1AG</a>).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
while the evening away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut">code of
conduct</a> even though it does seem more
informal.</p>

<p>If for some reason you can't make the talks you're still more than welcome to
attend this afterwards part.  We'd love to see you!</p>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8502-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup">register with our hosts
Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/8502-london-ruby-usergroup-meetup">register with Skills
Matter</a>.</p>
