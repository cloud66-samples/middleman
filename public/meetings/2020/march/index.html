<blockquote>
  <p>Email has been around for a long time, predating even the Internet, and
despite the best efforts of big tech to monopolise our communications,
it's still the most popular way to for people to communicate online.
This ubiquity means it's a really easy wayf or Government to keep in
touch with us, but email is a tricky thing to manage, running
mailservers can be a faff, and email as a service solutions can be
expensive. In this talk I'll go through a potted history of email, talk
about a tool that the Government Digital Service have developed to make
email easier for goverment agencies, and a Ruby gem I've build to make
it even easier for Rails devs.</p>

  <p>Story time! Here's the bug I found, how we determined it was a bug in
Rails 6, how we dealt with it including working around it and submitting
the bug report, and finally getting to remove our workaround once the
bug was fixed and the new Rails was installed :)</p>

<p>We should be finished these talks by 8pm.  Usually we head to a local pub
afterwards to talk about what we've just heard and get to know our fellow
attendees.  We'll see what Makers suggest for which is their preferred
watering hole and keep you posted if we know in advance.</p>

informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
