pulling data out of a database and rendering it on a website.</p>

  <p>Some time ago I stumbled across the header description for WAV files
and wondered, what if I took a file and calculated the appropriate WAV
file header for it, could I <em>hear</em> my data?  Yes, you can.  You probably
don't want to, but you can.  You can do something similar with BMP and
MIDI files too!</p>

of how your code quality is evolving over time is by setting it up on
your CI and storing the reports artefacts.</p>

<h4 id="you">You? <a href="#you" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>

<p>We’d like to hear from people using ruby for something that is a bit out
of the ordinary.  Mostly we’re probably all using ruby for building
websites, or for devops, but that’s not all ruby can do.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making music</li>
  <li>generating graphics</li>
  <li>interactive chatbots</li>
  <li>games</li>
  <li>etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what are you making ruby do that fits the bill?  Or, what are you
using ruby for that doesn’t fit that bill, but also isn’t a standard
webapp?  We'd love to hear about it, whatever it is.  Show us what ruby
can do!</p>

<h2 id="afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Our goal is to be finished exploring ruby's talents by 8pm, after which
we'll move to a nearby pub to talk about the talents on show and do a spot
of socialising.  We'll take advice from GoCardless on which local pub will
best accommodate us and keep you posted if we know in advance.</p>

<p>Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>.</p>

<h2 id="jan20registration">Venue &amp; Registration <a href="#jan20registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
<a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a> paying close attention to <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">the code of
