<blockquote>
  <p>What does it mean to make a system observable? Too often this is translated
into simply installing technical tools to measure low-level concerns like
memory, CPU or background queues size. In this talk, I will present the
concept of Domain-Oriented Observability, explore how it affects the cost
of maintaining your system and finally show some of the tools and solutions
that can help you put it into practice.</p>

  <p>There are various ways to achieve this, in this talk I'll present some of

groups of people that meet with a common goal in mind and relevant to the

may still be hungry.</p>

informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>.</p>
