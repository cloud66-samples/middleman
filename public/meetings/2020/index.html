<blockquote>
  <p>Everybody at LRUG probably uses open source software - unless they got lost on
the way to another meeting - but it often surprises me how few developers take
the extra step from using it, to contributing to (or releasing their own) open
source software projects. I'm going to talk about how I got involved in the
open source community, why I stay involved, and about my current open source
projects</p>

<p><a href="https://denny.me">Denny de la Haye</a> has been a programmer for nearly 30 years
now - "although my ZX81 code is thankfully all lost in the mists of time (AKA
audio cassettes and thermal printer paper)", he says. He has spent most of the
last 4+ years writing Ruby, and most of the 15+ before that writing Perl. The
switch between the two was less traumatic than he expected, but it did lead to
starting another open source software project last year…</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rails' most well-known mantra is "convention over configuration," i.e. sane
defaults that limit the cognitive overhead of application development. It's
easy to learn and easy to build with. The development experience is
fantastic… right up until the point you want to deploy your app to
production. It's at that point that the hand-holding stops.</p>

  <p>Heroku to the rescue, right? Just push your git repo to "heroku master" and
never think about deployment again! Heroku is a great option for many small
projects and the ease of deployment is exactly the kind of experience Rails
developers are used to. To quote Aaron Patterson: "but at what cost?" You're
tied to Heroku's stack and stuck within the limitations of their free tier.
Heroku's add-ons can get pretty expensive too if you decide to upgrade later
on.</p>

  <p>How can we, but humble Rails devs, achieve the same seamless, turnkey
deployment experience affordably? Enter the Kuby gem, a
convention-over-configuration approach to deploying Rails apps using
industry-leading technologies. Come learn how, with almost no configuration,
you too can use Kuby to leverage Docker and Kubernetes to deploy your Rails
app cost-effectively on a variety of cloud platforms.</p>

to be held (online) on the 18th &amp; 19th of July, between 2-6PM CET (so that's
1-5PM BST). They've got a great line up of very interesting talks, and of
course, it's never been easy or cheaper to attend a conference since there's no
travel or hotel costs to factor in. But <em>you</em> can reduce that cost to zero by
signing up to attend LRUG.</p>

<p>During the meeting, we'll run a raffle for all registered attendees and pick
two. And even if you don't win in the raffle, the organisers have arranged a
discount for LRUG members, which we'll share on the night.</p>

  <p>Today Agile is the default choice for software development out there. Every
conference, book, or blog post is telling us we are doomed to fail if we
don’t follow this established convention. But isn't it surprising to think
that Agile is advocated as the right methodology for every possible company
doing software out there? Are we going to organize software development
exactly the same way if we are working for a startup, NASA, or FedEx? It
seems hard to believe. In this presentation, I will explore the mental
model to help you choose when you should (or sometimes should not) use
Agile using the lenses of risk management. My goal is to provide guidance
for the puzzled business owner, project manager, or software developer who
wants to pick what's right for their company or team.</p>

talks for the rest of year, so please get in touch on <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#116;&#097;&#108;&#107;&#115;&#064;&#108;&#114;&#117;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;">&#116;&#097;&#108;&#107;&#115;&#064;&#108;&#114;&#117;&#103;&#046;&#111;&#114;&#103;</a>

<blockquote>
  <p>My company (Trapeze) specialises in public transport including schedule
optimisation. Finding Hamiltonian curves is a sub-problem to the
travelling salesman problem and of the general problem of optimising
pickup and drop-offs in demand responsive public transport. This talk
will compare implementing a Hamiltonian curve finder in a number of
different languages. The talk looks both at the speed of the language
and the elegance. For Ruby, I compare a couple of different
implementations. Other languages that are compared are Elixir, Go,
Javascript, Java, C++, C# and Python.</p>

  <p>The source code is in a public Github repository details of which I will
provide as part of my talk</p>

  <p>Some folks prefer 'puts' to debugging with something like
pry-byebug, but I'm a huge fan of debuggers, particularly stepping
through my own code and the code of the many libraries we all rely on.
In combination with <code>bundle open</code> to insert breakpoints into the code of
gems being used in your stack, debugging can expose really tricky
dependency bugs, as I aim to demonstrate with one that I found in the
way different ruby HTTP libraries can interact.</p>

  <p>The April 2020 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Monday the 6th of April</em>,

PhysicalProximityError: meetings of &gt; 2 people are currently forbidden
</code></p>

<p>That's right folks – while we all collectively do our part to battle COVID-19, LRUG too must adapt for this brave new world of <em>staying the hell indoors</em>.</p>

<p>The good news is that we've done some testing and we think we can hold a decent version of LRUG online, from the safety of our own respective homes. The very kind folks at <a href="https://meetcleo.com">Cleo</a> have loaned us their generously-appointed Zoom account and we're going to try running the meeting using that this month. There are likely to still be a few rough edges while we learn to translate our super-polished absolutely-no-faffing-around-ever-with-laptops-and-projectors high-production-value process into this new medium, but we will get there in the end.</p>

  <p>We all know how valuable it is to keep the quality of your code high. Working on a high quality codebase is more enjoyable and enables us to deliver value much more effectively for our users and yet, time and again I hear engineers saying, “I am not allowed to spend sufficient time on code quality”.</p>

  <p>This talk clarifies the value of maintaining a high quality codebase, gives you guidance on how to talk about this to help you get the support of your colleagues and managers for spending time on this and also outlines some key practices that will help you achieve this.</p>

<p>Afterwards… well, that's a good question. Obviously there's no pub, but we invite you instead to conjure up the image of a gently roaring fire, and perhaps to open a beer or other beverage while holding that image in your mind, and then think to yourself that it's really a wonder to be alive at all, even in strange times such as these, and really doesn't it demonstrate how much we all rely on each other, on our neighbours and colleagues and friends, and <em>gosh darn it</em> we shouldn't forget that when this is all over, that we truly do <em>need</em> each other, and we shouldn't take each other for granted, and dammit Billy I just gotta say it that <em>I love you dude</em>, I know I shoulda said it before all this, but I want to say it now so you know, you're a good friend Billy, you really are, and thanks for being there for me.</p>

  <p>Email has been around for a long time, predating even the Internet, and
despite the best efforts of big tech to monopolise our communications,
it's still the most popular way to for people to communicate online.
This ubiquity means it's a really easy wayf or Government to keep in
touch with us, but email is a tricky thing to manage, running
mailservers can be a faff, and email as a service solutions can be
expensive. In this talk I'll go through a potted history of email, talk
about a tool that the Government Digital Service have developed to make
email easier for goverment agencies, and a Ruby gem I've build to make
it even easier for Rails devs.</p>

<p>These lightning talks should be finished by 8pm after which we'll go to a
local pub to talk about all the things we've heard.  We'll defer to our
hosts for a suitable venue, and we'll make sure it does food for any who
may still be hungry.</p>

<p>Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>.</p>

<p>We’d like to hear from people using ruby for something that is a bit out
of the ordinary.  Mostly we’re probably all using ruby for building
websites, or for devops, but that’s not all ruby can do.</p>

<p>Some examples:</p>

<ul>
  <li>making music</li>
  <li>generating graphics</li>
  <li>interactive chatbots</li>
  <li>games</li>
  <li>etc…</li>
</ul>

<p>So, what are you making ruby do that fits the bill?  Or, what are you
using ruby for that doesn’t fit that bill, but also isn’t a standard
webapp?  We'd love to hear about it, whatever it is.  Show us what ruby
can do!</p>

<h2 id="january-2020-meeting--afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#january-2020-meeting--afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Our goal is to be finished exploring ruby's talents by 8pm, after which
we'll move to a nearby pub to talk about the talents on show and do a spot
of socialising.  We'll take advice from GoCardless on which local pub will
best accommodate us and keep you posted if we know in advance.</p>

<p>Of course, even though this is the socialising part and seems more
informal, please remember that still we consider it to be a part of the
meeting and covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">code of conduct</a>.</p>
