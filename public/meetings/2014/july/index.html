<p><a href="http://jgwmaxwell.com/">John Maxwell</a> wants to talk to us about automated deployment:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The first principle of the Agile Manifesto says “Our highest
priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
continuous delivery of valuable software”, yet too often this
is not the reality. Delivery is one of the most disruptive
parts of the software development process for developers, but
can be easy to automate, empowering the iterative process.
This talk is a manifesto for how to go from scratch to
automated deployment, with a few tales from the trenches of
mistakes made along the way.</p>

<p><a href="http://codon.com/">Tom Stuart</a> is going to re-introduce us to RSpec:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://relishapp.com/rspec/">RSpec 3</a> has just been released, and it's come a long way since
<a href="http://rspec.info">version 1</a>. If you've had problems with RSpec in the past, now
is a great time to revisit it — it's become much cleaner, simpler
and more focused. I'll give a quick overview of the main things
that have changed over the years, and if there's time, I'll
explain a few of the new features in version 3.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.techfox.co.uk/">Rosa Fox</a> will give us a talk she describes as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A short talk about my experience starting out as a professional
developer. The focus of this talk will be about a weekly event
through which I received a huge amount of support called <a href="http://codebar.io">Codebar</a>.
At Codebar programming skills are taught for free to people
underrepresented in the tech industry.</p>

<h2 id="pub">Pub <a href="#pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Our talks finish up around 8pm and you can find us crowding <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> by about 8:10pm.  We're a friendly group and this part of the evening is the perfect time to talk to the speakers and other attendees about the talks or other goings-on in the wider Ruby world.  If you didn't make the talks you're still welcome to come along for this pub bit!</p>

<h2 id="jul14registration">Registration <a href="#jul14registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6451-welcome-back-to-rspec-continuous-deliverance">register with our hosts Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget <a href="http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036">MINASWAN</a>), so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6451-welcome-back-to-rspec-continuous-deliverance">register with Skills Matter</a>.  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a>.</p>

<p>You can also follow <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-july/">this meeting on lanyrd</a>, but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?</p>
