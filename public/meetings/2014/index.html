  <p>RSpec 3 is the recently released new major version of 
RSpec. It contains a host of new features, and has

RSpec 3, the upgrade path between RSpec 2 and 3 and 
some of the common pitfalls that you might fall into
when using this new major version of RSpec.</p>

<p>That all sounds super-interesting and we'll want to talk it all over together, but we have to be out of Skills Matter by 8pm.  Don't worry though, that doesn't mean the evening is over!  <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> is a short walk away and has plenty of space for us to have those discussions.

<p><a href="http://www.sengupta.net/musings/">Avik Sengupta</a> wants to introduce us to a new language called <a href="http://julialang.org/">Julia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Can  a programming language be fast yet highly 
dynamic? The creators of Julia, a new language with 
a numeric focus intends to answer yes.</p>

  <p>In this talk we will introduce the language, and 
discuss some of its design and implementation 
decisions that make it particularly amenable to
generating efficient machine code. We will also talk
about Julia's impressive language interop features, 
and see examples of calling Ruby code from within Julia.</p>

  <p>I'll be looking at the basic technical concepts

and look at the Ruby techniques that make it easy to
be a good Unix citizen.</p>

Sonic Pi from its the humble beginnings of this
project in a single class of school-children coding
beeps and bleeps to its current standing as a
state-of-the-art live coding system installed by
default on all Raspberry Pis  used to live code
in a variety of venues from Algoraves to national
music venues.  All towards a simple but deep
question - how can we give more people an understanding
of what programming is and can do?</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bebox helps automating the provisioning of environments in which
Ruby on Rails applications run, easing the reproduction of new
server setups every time.</p>

  <p>Bebox's main concern is the structure. It is generally a good
idea to have conventions about how different source code files
are placed and named and be able to use this to reduce the
details required to understand a project while also providing
automation in key places. These conventions may include things
like: how to write puppet modules, how to integrate them into
the projects, a directory structure for the projects, how to
have a replicated “development/test” environment into virtual
machines, etc.</p>

days. No matter how fancy it is. <a href="http://guacamolegem.org/">Guacamole</a> is an ODM for
ArangoDB to be used in Rack-based framework and especially
Rails. I will talk about the design choices, caveats and my
the general experience working on that kind of library. The
talk will not go too deep into technical details and should
be interesting to novice and experts alike.</p>

<p><a href="http://alexspeller.com/">Alex Speller</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Music theory can seem arcane and unapproachable. But underneath
the weird names and symbols, the basics are actually pretty
simple. The real issue is that the documentation is bad and the
API is worse! In this talk I will show how to start with nothing
but a ruby interpreter, and generate sine waves, notes, scales,
modes, chords, arpeggios and songs, in a way that will be
understandable to those who have never touched an instrument
before and will (hopefully) offer an interesting new perspective
even to those who are already well versed in music theory.</p>

  <p>The first principle of the Agile Manifesto says “Our highest
priority is to satisfy the customer through early and
continuous delivery of valuable software”, yet too often this
is not the reality. Delivery is one of the most disruptive
parts of the software development process for developers, but
can be easy to automate, empowering the iterative process.
This talk is a manifesto for how to go from scratch to
automated deployment, with a few tales from the trenches of
mistakes made along the way.</p>

  <p>Hola amigos! We need to have a chat about data structures
and algorithms. I've been messing around with them on-and-off
over the past few years and I believe you'll find spending
more time learning them valuable. Here's what I'm going to
talk about:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>Why you should bother learning about them at all, especially if you think you won't use them at work.</li>
    <li>Some fun examples of data structures/algos you've heard of (and probably some you haven't) and how they're put to work in software you use every day.</li>
    <li>Ways of learning them that I've found to be fun and effective.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>I swear in the name of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Knuth</a> that there shall be no mention of
big-o notation or sorting algorithms. Also, I will attempt a
live demo of one of the algos using the <abbr title="Shout Across The Room">SATR</abbr> transport
protocol. It probably won't work if you are good at the maths
and feeling mischievous.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/dasil003">Gabe da Silveira</a> is going to talk to us about ActiveResource:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ruby on Rails has always been optimized for a single monolithic application
architecture.  But as applications grow, it has become more and more common
for architects to seek out ways to break their monolithic Rails apps into
self-contained services.  For years the most natural answer of how to hook
up one Rails app to another's API has been to use ActiveResource, a core
Rails plugin that provides an ActiveRecord-like interface to an external service.</p>

  <p>The allure of such a simple interface to a network service is undeniable, but
the downsides not nearly as obvious.  Many have built Rails apps relying on
ActiveResource only to feel significant unforeseen pain down the line.  This
talk provides a case study of an early adopter of ActiveResource during the
Rails 1.2 era, the pain that it led to, and the eventual replacement of
ActiveResource with a bespoke private gem that provides a similar, but more
robust interface.</p>

<p><a href="http://camillebaldock.co.uk/">Camille Baldock</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of us developers love arguing about architecture that
we dislike and refactoring our code to loosen coupling and
weaken dependencies between our objects. Unfortunately,
some overarching parts of our applications, like persistence,
networking, notifications, logging, auditing, are scattered
in our code, forcing us to specific explicit dependencies
between them and our domain objects.</p>

  <p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aspect-oriented_programming">Aspect-oriented programming</a>
is a solution to the problem of some features affecting
virtually all business requirements, and expresses that problem
in a compact and DRY way.</p>

  <p>In this practical talk, Camille will:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>introduce the basic concepts of AOP, and how it is still relevant even in a non-statically typed language like Ruby</li>
    <li>show you how to easily and quickly leverage some AOP principles in your Rails application</li>
    <li>play with some AOP-friendly constructs in Ruby 2, in particular TracePoint</li>
    <li>walk you through two existing Ruby frameworks to practice Aspect-Oriented Programming</li>
  </ul>

  <p>She will even attempt to prove that not all things coming from the Java world are necessarily bad.</p>

<p><a href="http://uk.linkedin.com/in/derekahill/">Derek Hill</a> from <a href="http://www.eBench.com">eBench</a> wants to talk to us about marketing:</p>

  <p>I’m a relative newcomer to Ruby, but I’ve got lots of experience in
marketing.</p>

  <p>Over the last two years I’ve spoken to many experienced devs about
their marketing challenges, and witnessed how simple marketing
mistakes can derail a project.</p>

  <p>In the consumer goods industry marketing is a discipline, with
structured ways of working through it.   I will demonstrate that
this structure works well for tech startups, and give you a
practical checklist you can apply.</p>

<p><a href="http://home.ismaelcelis.com/">Ismael Celis</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I would like to talk about a series of custom-made infrastructure
components that I’ve built over several months to support a hosted
e-commerce app that I run in my spare time.</p>

  <p>This consists of a central events hub written in Go, to which the
user-facing apps send events, and a series of Go and Ruby scripts
subscribing to said events on a ZMQ socket and doing varied things
such as analytics, periodical backups and house-keeping.</p>

  <p>The code I’ll show is mostly Go, with some Ruby to illustrate how
this all hooks in to my Ruby apps and existing infrastructure. I’ll
try to show why Go is great for writing small, focused scripts that
support your user facing apps.</p>

<p><a href="http://javier-ramirez.com/">Javier Ramirez</a> wants to tell us about dealing with big data:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At <a href="https://teowaki.com/">teowaki</a> we have a system for API usage analytics,
with <a href="http://redis.io/">Redis</a> as a fast intermediate store and
<a href="https://developers.google.com/bigquery/">bigquery</a> as a big data
backend. As a result, we can launch aggregated queries on our
traffic/usage data in just a few seconds and we can try and find
for usage patterns that wouldn’t be obvious otherwise.</p>

  <p>In this session I will talk about how we entered the Big Data
world, which alternatives we evaluated, and how we are using
Redis and Bigquery to solve our problem.</p>
