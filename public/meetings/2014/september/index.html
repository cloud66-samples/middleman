<p><a href="http://houseofmnowster.com/">Mazz Mosley</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You'll never guess what happens next? Mazz will talk about some
of the essential skills that good technical leaders exhibit and
the information you need to know about to help you become good
at leading and not turn into a terrible person. Do you find
yourself in a position of leadership and don't know what to do
now? Do you think you're a great tech lead? Do you wonder if
you're cut out to lead one day? Great, then come and listen to
my talk, you may find it more relevant to your interests than
you realise.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.codescrum.com/">Jairo Diaz</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Bebox helps automating the provisioning of environments in which
Ruby on Rails applications run, easing the reproduction of new
server setups every time.</p>

  <p>Bebox's main concern is the structure. It is generally a good
idea to have conventions about how different source code files
are placed and named and be able to use this to reduce the
details required to understand a project while also providing
automation in key places. These conventions may include things
like: how to write puppet modules, how to integrate them into
the projects, a directory structure for the projects, how to
have a replicated “development/test” environment into virtual
machines, etc.</p>

<p><a href="http://danielsun.co.uk/">Daniel Sun</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Having recently completed the training phase of WeGotCoders I
will present some code from <a href="https://github.com/dan-mi-sun/the-soul-at-work">my final project</a> of the 12 week
training course / some code recently pulled into <a href="https://www.joindiaspora.com/">Diaspora*</a>.
With more and more of us choosing this route, the aim is to
show those interested in the 'Immersion' model (either
attending a course, or hiring someone who has joined a course)
what someone with no prior coding experience can achieve
within 12 weeks.</p>

<p>When the talks finish there's usually lots to mull over and talk about.  We have to leave Skills Matter's offices, but we don't stop the meeting; it continues at <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> which is a 5 minute walk away.  If you are unable to attend the talks, or miss out on a space, come join us for the socialising afterwards.</p>

<h2 id="sep14registration">Registration <a href="#sep14registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6530-lrug-september-meetup">register with our hosts Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget <a href="http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036">MINASWAN</a>), so please do <a href="https://www.skillsmatter.com/meetups/6530-lrug-september-meetup">register with Skills Matter</a>.  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a>.</p>

<p>You can also follow <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2014/lrug-september/">this meeting on lanyrd</a>, but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?</p>
