  <p>The November meeting will be on <em>Monday</em> the 8th of November, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96">The Skills Matter eXchange</a>.  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#nov10registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.</p>

<p>Git has taken the Ruby world by storm, and many of us are using 'git push' on a daily basis. Priit is going to talk about how to use git hooks and will highlight some everyday tips that he has developed and found useful. He's also going to talk about easy ways to replicate Heroku-like deployment for smaller projects using git.</p>

<p>A video of Priit's talk, filmed by Skills Matter, <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/using-git-hooks-for-staging-and-production">is available on the Skills Matter site</a>.</p>

<h3 id="kalvir-sandhu---more-websockets">Kalvir Sandhu - More Websockets <a href="#kalvir-sandhu---more-websockets" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>Kalv will give an overview of Websockets and how to get a simple app up and running with <a href="http://github.com/lifo/cramp">Cramp</a>. He'll walk through creating a chat based app using Cramp &amp; websockets and will talk briefly on security and authentication with websockets.</p>

<p>A video of Kalvir's talk, filmed by Skills Matter, <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/more-websockets">is available on the Skills Matter site</a>.</p>

<h3 id="analogue-blog">"Analogue Blog" <a href="#analogue-blog" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>We start the meetings with short announcements about anything and everything that the group might be interested in.  We announce when people are hiring, we announce new conferences that people might want to attend or present at, we announce interesting blog posts to spark debate in the pub afterwards.  Anything goes really!  You don't have to ask for permission, just get up and say your piece, but keep it quick so you don't run on into the time for the scheduled talks.  In fact if it's longer than a minute, maybe you should think about <a href="/speaking/">doing a longer talk</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pub">Pub <a href="#pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>At the end of the evening we'll all head on over to <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> to continue the meeting in more informal surroundings.  The main meeting should finish around 8pm, so you'll find us ordering our drinks at the bar shortly after.  If you don't think you can make it for the workshop you really should think about coming along for drinks later on, as no doubt there'll be lots of interesting chat in the pub.</p>

<h2 id="nov10registration">Registration <a href="#nov10registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Skills Matter prefer that you <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug/rl-311">register your attendance with them</a> if you are coming to the meeting.  On a few exceptional occasions we've had to turn away people who haven't registered, but this has only been at extremely popular meetings, and has yet to happen at the new venue on Goswell Road.  It's better to be safe than sorry though, and it is polite (don't forget <a href="http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036">MINASWAN</a>), so please do <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug/rl-311">register</a>.</p>
