<p><a href="http://www.spacevatican.org/">Frederick Cheung</a> will talk to us about FFI:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We all love ruby, but sometimes ruby is not enough. Whether it be a
performance bottleneck, a killer library written in C or some
platform specific functionality you just have to have, sometimes you
need to drop down a level.</p>

  <p>There have been many talks that show how to take the first steps in
writing a ruby C extension. This isn't one of them. I propose
instead to give an overview of different ways of extending ruby and
show what each approach brings to the table. I intend to cover
'classic' C extensions, RubyInline and FFI across a range of ruby
implementations.</p>

<p><a href="http://iankynnersley.co.uk/">Ian Kynnersley</a> describes his talk as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>What do we mean when we talk about simplicity? Why is it important and why is

<p><a href="http://www.thechrisoshow.com/">Chris O'Sullivan</a> is going to give us 15 minutes on Objective-C:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There are so many things we take for granted writing Ruby code -
initialising hashes and arrays, doing basic arithmetic with floats and
integers, using subscript accessors for containers.  Trying to do
these basic things in Objective C requires writing screeds of
boilerplate code.</p>

  <p>Well, it's time to have another look at Objective C.</p>

  <p>The latest version of the compiler includes some wonderful shortcuts
to make your code more concise, readable, and a lot more like Ruby. In
this talk I'll give you a whirlwind tour of these changes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A zero-downtime deployment configuration is important for
critical systems that need to handle every request (i.e.
financial system) and lately for systems following
continuous delivery  principles since there could be many
frequent deployments .  This talks present a simple
configuration for zero-downtime deployments for ruby
applications.</p>

<p><a href="http://freelancing-gods.com/">Pat Allan</a> is going to tell us all about writing <a href="http://rubygems.org/">rubygems</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Gems underpin almost every piece of Ruby code we write – and so, being
able to write your own gems is not only incredibly useful, it provides
an avenue for code reuse and open source sharing. I'll be talking about
the ecosystem around gems and the fundamentals for writing your own gem
from the ground up, plus some of the tools available to assist with
this, along with ideal approaches and best practices for gem
development.</p>

<p><a href="http://kapoq.com/">David Nolan</a> has an idea about nil:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>nil in Ruby is neat, simple, and convenient. But it's also problematic.
It infiltrates our code, silently, until boom! 'undefined method foo
for nil:NilClass' (or - true story, there's no time to explain -
suddenly thousands of Mark Zuckerbergs).</p>

  <p>In this talk, I take a deep dive into nil, NULL, undefined, Maybe and
other ghosts in Ruby and beyond. I want uncover important concepts that
I think are obscured by by nil's convenience. And I think nil can be so
corrosive it's worth asking why we need it at all. Can we eliminate it
completely? Can it be improved?</p>

  <p>Sure, there are decent Ruby patterns and practices for living with nil,
and I'll take a look at them. But I'll also try to illuminate nil by
way of a vintage Soviet computer, Jainism, a billion dollars, a
Peruvian tribe, and a Victorian wooden adding machine. And, since this
is Ruby, there will some reckless live monkey-patching.</p>

<p><a href="http://samsworldofno.com/">Sam Phillips</a> is going to tell us all about feature switching:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Releasing a big change to an application, whether a large overhaul of
the UX, system migration or upgrade to the internals, can be daunting.
Will the change work technically? Will it make your users happy and
improve the desired metrics? This talk discusses strategies and
technologies you can use to gradually roll changes out to gather early
feedback and prove your assumptions. It includes in-depth looks at
some technologies available (including the <a href="https://github.com/jamesgolick/rollout">rollout</a> gem), as well as the
part that gradual feature rollout has to play within your agile
process.</p>

  <p>These are all true stories, most of which I've been involved in. I'll
cover experiences of products and projects of varying sizes, talk
about different solutions for different environments and, just to be
fair, I include the humiliating (character-building) mistakes I've
made along the way.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ruby is an amazing language, it has an beautiful object model, a
concise syntax and it allows you to write functional code
elegantly. It's probably one of the most powerful programming
languages out there, yet, there are still some things it cannot
do. Let's explore those aspects because it'll open our minds to
think differently but most important, because it's fun!</p>

<p><a href="http://spacevatican.org/">Frederick Cheung</a> came back from <a href="http://railsconf2012.com/">RailsConf</a> with two things.  The first was one of the <a href="http://youtu.be/tWmh4m2a4FI?t=12m38s">2012 Ruby Hero awards</a>, and the second was that he was fired up to give a talk to his local user group.  Who are we to say no to a Ruby Hero?  Exactly, so he's going to tell us about <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a>:
&gt; Most apps need some form of search or filtering at some point
&gt; (even if they don't need full text). <a href="http://www.elasticsearch.org/">Elasticsearch</a> is a new(ish)
&gt; search engine built on top of <a href="http://lucene.apache.org/">Lucene</a> with some interesting features
&gt; that set it apart from other search engines such as sphinx or solr.
&gt;
&gt; I'll show what we've used elasticsearch for and why we picked it over
&gt; competing solutions such as solr or sphinx.</p>

<p><a href="mattwynne.net">Matt Wynne</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/tooky">Steve Tooke</a> are going to give us a version of their Hexagonal Rails talk (which they'll also be giving at <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/">SRC</a> and <a href="http://goruco.com/">Goruco</a> later this year):</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The things that make Rails great in the first few weeks of a new project are
precisely what makes it hurt after a few months. Anyone who has worked on a
medium-sized Rails app will have experienced pain like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>High coupling, meaning you have to run all your tests all the time to check
each change.</li>
    <li>Slow tests.</li>
    <li>Logic littered in view templates or helper modules.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Changes get more and more expensive to make, and the fun grinds to a halt.
How can you stop this from happening? And more importantly, how can you turn
around a project that’s already hit this wall of pain?</p>

  <p>You need to pull your app away from Rails.</p>

  <p>In this practical talk, we describe <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PortsAndAdaptersArchitecture">an architecture</a> for mature Rails
applications where the framework becomes a <a href="http://confreaks.com/videos/759-rubymidwest2011-keynote-architecture-the-lost-years">plug-in</a> to your application.
With hands-on demonstrations, you’ll learn how to define clear boundaries
between your application’s domain and Rails’ domain. Now Rails can stick
to doing what it does best – providing the persistence and HTTP stack –
and your valuable business logic will be in <a href="http://blog.steveklabnik.com/posts/2011-09-06-the-secret-to-rails-oo-design">plain old</a> <a href="http://devblog.avdi.org/2011/11/15/early-access-beta-of-objects-on-rails-now-available-2/">Ruby objects</a> that
are <a href="http://arrrrcamp.be/videos/2011/corey-haines---fast-rails-tests/">fast</a> to <a href="https://www.destroyallsoftware.com/screencasts/catalog/fast-tests-with-and-without-rails">test</a> and easy to reason about.</p>

<p><a href="http://jabberwocky.eu/">Elise Huard</a> is going to give us a version of the talk she has proposed for <a href="http://www.euruko2012.org/">EuRuKo 2012</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Garbage Collector: how does it work?
What does it mean when people speak about stop-the-world,
mark-and-sweep, generational garbage collectors?
How does ruby fare at collecting its own garbage?
What does it mean when they say 1.9.3's garbage collector has improved?
This talk will explain those concepts, what the impact of garbage
collection is on our programs, and what future could be.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's received wisdom that Ruby doesn't need dependency injection
frameworks. In this talk, I'll claim that this is at least in
part because we don't apply the <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf">Dependency Inversion Principle</a>
properly. I'll explore the intent of the principle, its benefits
for maintainable and testable code, and show how to improve
existing code through its application.</p>

  <p>I'll then go on to explore how to create objects with dependencies
wired in, hoping to settle the question of whether we need a framework to do this.</p>

  <p>dRuby stands for "Distributed Ruby" and it's one of less known Ruby
standard libraries.  It is one of the first use of Metaprogramming
long before Rails. dRuby creates proxy objects which lets you to

one of the Ruby core committers and has been using Ruby since
version 1.2. I learnt a lot of interesting Ruby technique from him
and would like to share some of them with you.</p>

<p><a href="http://vandenabeele.com/">Peter Vandenabeele</a> want to talk to us about his experiences converting an Ruby on Rails app from MRI Ruby to JRuby:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Starting from a scaffold Rails app with RSpec and mysql/postgresl
what are the steps to get rspec to pass on JRuby:
 * use .rvmrc to switch between MRI and JRuby
 * switch out gems (db, server side js, factory_girl 3 vs. 2)
 * require_relative =&gt; use proper load path
 * using 1.9 compatible mode for new style hashes
 * waiting for rspec takes longer …
 * use JRuby to connect to a Java lib (e.g. HBase jar) :-)</p>

  <p>The March 2012 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Monday</em> the 12th of March, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96">The Skills Matter eXchange</a>.  <a href="#mar12registration">Registration details are given below</a>.</p>

<h3 id="march-2012-meeting--tdd-fishbowl">TDD Fishbowl <a href="#march-2012-meeting--tdd-fishbowl" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://madebymany.com/people/stuart-eccles">Stuart Eccles</a>, fresh from talking about <a href="https://github.com/madebymany/conan">Conan the Deployer</a> at our <a href="/meetings/2012/01/24/february-2012-meeting/">February Meeting</a>, has offered to organise a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fishbowl_(conversation)">Fishbowl</a> session focussing on approaches to TDD.</p>

<p>The idea is not to focus on tedious tool debates like Test::Unit vs. RSpec or Cucumber vs. raw ruby for integration testing; these debates have rang throughout the ages and will continue to do so.  We want to explore other debates, such as Obie Fernandez's <a href="http://blog.obiefernandez.com/content/2011/07/the-next-big-leap.html">suggestion that TDD might not be the best approach for early-stage startups</a>.</p>

<p>The format on the night will be that we'll have a couple of short opening statements from the panel to seed the discussion and then get going on the discussion.  The fishbowl format means that we have 5 chairs at the front, 1 of which is empty.  People on the chairs can speak, and if someone from the audience wants to add something to the conversation, they can go up and take the empty chair.  As soon as this happens, one of the original panelists must go and sit down.</p>

<p>The initial panel will be:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/stueccles">Stuart Eccles</a> - Writing tests before validating the business value is pointless</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/tomstuart">Tom Stuart</a> - Rails encourages you to to TDD wrong</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/josephwilk">Joseph Wilk</a> - The cargo culting of TDD without considering if and why</li>
  <li><a href="http://twitter.com/mortice">Tom Stuart</a> - The "fast specs" paradigm is a red herring for producing better code</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/hlame">Murray Steele</a> will act as moderator, but anyone can get involved by claiming the empty fifth chair.</p>
