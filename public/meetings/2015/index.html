<p><a href="https://github.com/tansaku">Sam Joseph</a> is going to lead us through a practical exercise he calls "CodeWarsJam".  He describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A CodeWarsJam is a session where small teams of coders work on the same coding
problem together.  The problems are usually relatively simple and can be
reviewed as a group every 20 minutes or so.  Recently at
<a href="http://www.makersacademy.com/">MakersAcademy</a> we've had great fun with
CodeWarsJams, where we take coding kata from <a href="http://codewars.com">http://codewars.com</a>
and use them to run a CodeWarsJam.  CodeWarsJam is great because when you
solve a problem you get to see all the other variant solutions that others
have coded, sorted by popularity.  Come join the festive coding fun as LRUG's
first CodeWarsJam!</p>

<p><a href="http://codon.com">Tom Stuart</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Rubyâs billed as a âmulti-paradigmâ language, but, letâs face it, we
use it to write imperative object-oriented programs. I'm interested in
different ways of programming computers, because I reckon imperative
programs are far too low-level and overspecified, which is why as a
species we're generally terrible at writing them. In this talk I want
to encourage you to think outside of your normal programming habits;
Iâll present a more abstract and declarative style called relational
programming, and show you how to implement a minimal relational
language in Ruby. (Dog whistle: this is <a href="http://webyrd.net/scheme-2013/papers/HemannMuKanren2013.pdf">Î¼kanren</a>.)</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/tuzz">Chris Patuzzo</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Every day, we write software that solves business problems. How we
actually do that is largely up to us. We tend to build models that
encapsulate complexity and provide abstractions that help us reason
about the problems we solve.</p>

  <p>We stress our models with incremental development. Changing business
requirements challenge the durability of our models. The magnitude of
change is an indicator for the effectiveness of our models' ability to
represent the problem domain.</p>

  <p>At <a href="https://github.com/whichdigital">Which?</a> we used <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven_design">Domain Driven
Design</a> to deliver
our most recent project. In this talk, I will share those insights. I
aim to cut through the jargon and give concrete, real-world examples of
how we applied the principles of DDD to build a product that
anticipates change.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At Makers Academy we coach students through the process of learning
Ruby, Sinatra, Rails, JavaScript, JQuery and Angular over the course of
12 weeks.  Students range in age from 18 to 60, although the majority
are in their late 20s or early 30s, already have university degrees
(often a humanities subject) and have spent 5+ years in the workplace
doing sales, marketing, design, management or some other relatively
non-technical role.  The majority of students have also had almost no
programming experience prior to their preparation for the interview and
selection process that they must go through to get on the course.  In
this talk I will explore what makes a 12 week intensive bootcamp tick,
and the particular challenges the students face with learning Ruby and
JavaScript.</p>

  <p>One of the main purposes of testing is to enable us to trust the
performance of our code in an automated way. Unfortunately, several
problems often arise with automated tests. One common and particularly
annoying problem that we began experiencing in our codebase was
flakiness.</p>

  <p>In this talk, I will discuss common problems that may cause this issue,
and some solutions we discovered based on our own experience at
SimplyBusiness.</p>

  <p>There are very few things that are part of my go-to toolbox, but Redis
is one of those things. I don't think there's a better, more flexible
piece of infrastructure you can have at your disposal.</p>

  <p>I'll cover the very basics of using Redis and general patterns that you
can use within your own systems. I'll also share some concrete examples
of what we've used it for at Cronofy.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is the story of a company that survived a much needed
transformation of its product and codebase, but most importantly, of
its culture. There's no real prescription for being agile. It's about
the journey a team takes to discover how to best work together and
deliver great products.</p>

  <p>In this presentation, I'll share a candid view of a team trying to
overcome a slow product development process. How we refactored our way
out of badly coupled code, moved to continuous deployment, and greatly
improved our approach to product and software development.</p>

It can become a mess very, very quickly.</p>

  <p>Have you ever dreamed of hosting your own apt repository? When
was the last time you were annoyed about slow deployment times
because the asset pipeline needs to run every single server
your app runs on? Oh and lets not mention installing ruby
version managers on servers, ok? (I will though).</p>

  <p>In this talk I will show how packaging (and deploying) Ruby
applications doesnât have to be hard or time consuming and can
work with a project of any size.</p>

<p>Thanks to the nice folks at <a href="http://www.team-prime.com/">Team Prime</a> and <a href="http://2015.bathruby.org">Bath Ruby</a> we are able to provide 4 people with free tickets and a Â£70 allowance (enough to cover return train travel from London).  The tickets are available to LRUG members that wouldn't otherwise be able to attend.  The deadline to put your name forward for a ticket is <em>midnight</em> on <em>Sunday 8th, February 2014</em>.  If more than 4 people request the tickets a draw will be held privately to select the winners.  The recipients of the tickets will not be publicly announced, but we'll thank Team Prime and the Bath Ruby Conf organisers at the start of the meeting.</p>

<p>All those talks are bound to generate some thoughts we'd like to discuss afterwards.  So we cross Goswell Road and head down to <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> to have those discussions in a more informal setting.  If you didn't make it for the talks then do feel free to turn up just for this bit.</p>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6984-lrug-lightening-talks-evening">register with our hosts Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on the same night.  Also, it's polite (don't forget <a href="http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036">MINASWAN</a>), so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/6984-lrug-lightening-talks-evening">register with Skills Matter</a>.  Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a>.</p>

<p>You can also follow <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2015/lrug-february/">this meeting on lanyrd</a>, but this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attend.  It's just for the lols, innit?</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/robb1e">Robbie Clutton</a> isn't, that's for sure:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many Rails codebases I look at work hard to put all logic into
the application source code, using the database only a dumb
store. But, there are circumstances where it makes sense to
leverage features of a database and in this talk I'll cover one
of those features in Views. I'll walk through examples of why you
might want logic in two places, how views compare to caching
for performance considerations, using views as a facade on
legacy tables and how to test views alongside your application.</p>
