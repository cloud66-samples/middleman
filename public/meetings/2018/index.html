  <p>Business is slow for Ruby Private Investigator, Deirdre Bug. She’s
on the verge of switching industry when she gets a call from an
anxious young man. "Some class methods have gone missing," he tells
her breathlessly. "I need your help."</p>

  <p>Deirdre takes the case and begins exploring Ruby objects behind the
scenes. Though she thinks she's on familiar ground — Ruby's object
model, method lookup — she's about to discover that she really has no
clue.</p>

  <p>To get maximum performance out of a language, compilation is key, and people &gt; have been trying to compile Ruby for a long time, ranging from jRuby and
Truffle Ruby to the experimental method JIT in Ruby 2.6. But Ruby is a very
challenging language to compile efficiently. The talk will explore some of
the reasons based on what I've learned while working on my own Ruby compiler
as described in my series of blog posts at http://hokstad.com/compiler</p>

<p>We aim to finish up the talks by 8pm.  This doesn't mean you have to go home

drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y

as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
while the evening away.</li>

<p>Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut">code of

informal.</p>

<p>Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.

afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.</p>

  <p>The cloud has evolved from just a few services like virtual machines to offering so much more. Asfand will discuss how these amazing new services can be used to support and enhance web apps written in frameworks like Rails, allowing us to reap the benefits of the modern cloud while delegating lots of laborious infrastructure management away to the cloud providers themselves.</p>

<p>We've got three great talks for you in August:</p>

<h2 id="august-2018-meeting--the-fast-and-the-furriest---performance-refactoring-with-bunnies">The Fast and The Furriest - Performance refactoring with bunnies <a href="#august-2018-meeting--the-fast-and-the-furriest---performance-refactoring-with-bunnies" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sroopsunar">Sroop Sunar</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been a developer for several years and throughout my career I’ve learned how to write clean, well-tested code. I’ve also discovered that sometimes writing the most beautiful poetic code can be horrendously slow when working with lots of data. What I really want is fast code. I know the topic of performance can seem intimidating at first - don’t worry I am by no means an expert in performance either! My talk isn't about compiler optimisation, multithreading, profilers, buffer management or cyclomatic complexity. In fact, what I’ve found is that optimising code doesn’t need to be more complicated than good old fashioned refactoring. Using a real problem that I encountered, my talk will take you through how I made slow code fast. Oh, and bunnies. Lots and lots of bunnies.</p>

<h2 id="july-2018-meeting--agenda">Agenda <a href="#july-2018-meeting--agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Our July meeting has three fantastic talks:</p>

<h2 id="july-2018-meeting--write-better-tests-with-property-based-testing">Write better tests with property based testing <a href="#july-2018-meeting--write-better-tests-with-property-based-testing" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/suzyhamilton">Suzanne Hamilton</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We write automated tests to give us confidence in our code, but bugs still
fall between the cracks. In this talk I'll show you how to apply the
techniques of property-based testing to use randomly-generated data to drive
out more bugs with fewer tests. I'll demonstrate these techniques using the
new Hypothesis for Ruby library which is based on the popular Hypothesis
Python library.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/knotnicky">Nicky Thompson</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Web design is getting boring. We're not learning enough from our history, and
so we're doomed to repeat our mistakes. You won't get your message across
effectively if your website looks like all the other websites out there.</p>

  <p>This talk will cover some of that history in an attempt to help us all learn
from it. You'll also learn some cool new ways CSS can help you stand out,
after which you will be armed with practical help to use these techniques,
the knowledge of when to use them (and when not to), and arguments to help
convince your colleagues of your great new ideas.</p>

meeting by making some pizza and drinks available.  These will be made available

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alinajaf">Najaf Ali</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This talk is about how we grew the team at Happy Bear Software. In this talk
I'll discuss:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How working at a given company fits into a developer's career</li>
    <li>Finding candidates</li>
    <li>Selection</li>
    <li>On-boarding</li>
    <li>Retention</li>
    <li>What to do when people leave your team</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Much of how we hire is specific to our business and our goals, but there will
hopefully be two or three techniques, practices, or principles that you can
apply to your hiring process.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jalada">David Somers</a> wants to tell us how to protect the software you build:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll start by talking briefly about the protocols computers use to
communicate. Then I'll discuss how they can be abused by demoing some of the
tools and techniques security professionals (and hackers) use to scan and
infiltrate servers. If the demo gods are on my side, I’ll break in to a
vulnerable system or two to show you how easy it is for people to exploit
known vulnerabilities in software you, as a software developer, may be
responsible for keeping up to date. Then finally I'll cover some ways to
protect the software you write from those types of attacks.</p>

  <p>The May 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Wednesday the 9th of May</em>,
from <em>6:00pm</em> to <em>8:00pm</em> (talks start at <em>6:30pm</em>).  The venue, <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code
Node</a> between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com">Skills Matter</a>.  <a href="#may18registration">Full venue and
registration details are given below</a>.</p>

<h2 id="may-2018-meeting--agenda">Agenda <a href="#may-2018-meeting--agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We've got three great talks for you in May:</p>

<h2 id="may-2018-meeting--software-development--a-view-from-the-boardroom">Software Development – a view from the Boardroom <a href="#may-2018-meeting--software-development--a-view-from-the-boardroom" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alanbuxton">Alan Buxton</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chances are you are building software for a business to use or sell, or both.
It’s likely that there is a board of directors involved making decisions that
affect you and your software. This talk aims to give you a personal insight
into what it’s like to be a CTO on a startup’s board in the hope that it
gives you another perspective on ‘the business’ and helps you become a more
rounded developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="may-2018-meeting--an-introduction-to-event-sourcing">An Introduction to Event Sourcing <a href="#may-2018-meeting--an-introduction-to-event-sourcing" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mottalrd">Alfredo Motta</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event sourcing</a> is a recently
developed design pattern to build applications that are domain centric and easy to
extend. The pattern is based on the usage of a persistent event log which 
substitutes the more classical relational database model for Rails applications.
Such event log can then be used for extending your application in all sort of 
creative ways. For example, by synchronizing data between your microservices, 
trigger side effects without cluttering your models or controllers, or build data
views optimized for your query needs. In this talk, I'll present the basic ideas, 
some of the tradeoffs and challenges you might find and how you could start 
experimenting with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="may-2018-meeting--on-writing--code-">On Writing &lt;%= code %&gt; <a href="#may-2018-meeting--on-writing--code-" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elliotthilaire">Elliot Hilaire</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing code in high-level programming languages began in the 1950s. In contrast, 
writing goes back more than 5000 years. So, what can we learn from people who
study writing? This talk explores concepts from three books about writing and 
applies them to coding.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="may-2018-meeting--afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#may-2018-meeting--afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We should be done with the talks by 8pm, but there's bound to be plenty
to talk about after these so if you want to chat to your fellow attendees or
the speakers afterwards you have a couple of choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code Node</a>.  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y
1AG</a>).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
while the evening away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut">code of
conduct</a> even though it does seem more
informal.</p>

<p>Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.</p>

  <p>As developers, we’re always asked to write more documentation. Some of us
even do it without being asked. But look around the web and you’ll see
countless gems, applications and source code examples whose documentation
is either missing or makes no sense. How can we make little changes to the
way we think about documentation to make things better?</p>

  <p>Enumerator is a pattern that not too many developers are often exposed to,

<p>Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.

afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.</p>

Node</a> between

<h3 id="january-2018-meeting--quiz">Quiz! <a href="#january-2018-meeting--quiz" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>Our first meeting of 2018 will be a slightly different kind of thing.  Instead
of talks there'll be a quiz.  We did this in <a href="/meetings/2007/january">2007</a> and
<a href="/meetings/2013/january/">2013</a> so if you attended those you'll know what to
expect.  If not the details are below</p>

<h4 id="january-2018-meeting--format">Format <a href="#january-2018-meeting--format" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>

<p>The quiz will be run as 5 separate rounds.  The first four are themed on the
words in LRUG (London, Ruby, Users, and Group).  The 5th round is a picture
round which will be given to each team to complete throughout the evening and
marked at the end.  The picture round questions will be based around the same
4 themes as the other rounds.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Round 1: <em>L</em>ondon</li>
  <li>Round 2: <em>R</em>uby (more community and history than technical details)</li>
  <li>Round 3: <em>U</em>sers (famous and historical people)</li>
  <li>Round 4: <em>G</em>roup (music)</li>
  <li>Round 5: picture round</li>
</ul>

<p>Each round will have 10 questions, but there'll be bonus points available
throughout the quiz for exceptional answers.</p>

<h4 id="january-2018-meeting--rules">Rules <a href="#january-2018-meeting--rules" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>

<ol>
  <li>Teams should have no more than 4 members (we may adjust this up or down on
the night depending on attendance or prize divisibility).</li>
  <li>Utilising internet devices to obtain answers is strictly forbidden - we
expect you to use your onboard brain, not your outboard one.</li>
  <li>The quiz master's word is final in any disputes.</li>
</ol>

<h4 id="january-2018-meeting--prizes">Prizes <a href="#january-2018-meeting--prizes" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h4>

your stomach of helping us out the benefits of sponsorship <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#sponsorship">are explained
on our readme site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="january-2018-meeting--afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#january-2018-meeting--afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We aim to finish the quiz by 8pm (although it may over-run depending on how
long the marking and prize-giving takes).  There's bound to be some heated
debate about how cruel the questions were and how your particularly funny
ruby pun-based team name was robbed of the best team-name bonus. If you'd
like to socialise with other LRUG attendees afterwards you have two choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code Node</a>.  Skills Matter run a cash bar with a
choice of drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members
you can network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are
hosting on the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y
1AG</a>).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
