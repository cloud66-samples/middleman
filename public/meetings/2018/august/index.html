<h2 id="agenda">Agenda <a href="#agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We've got three great talks for you in August:</p>

<h2 id="the-fast-and-the-furriest---performance-refactoring-with-bunnies">The Fast and The Furriest - Performance refactoring with bunnies <a href="#the-fast-and-the-furriest---performance-refactoring-with-bunnies" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/sroopsunar">Sroop Sunar</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been a developer for several years and throughout my career I’ve learned how to write clean, well-tested code. I’ve also discovered that sometimes writing the most beautiful poetic code can be horrendously slow when working with lots of data. What I really want is fast code. I know the topic of performance can seem intimidating at first - don’t worry I am by no means an expert in performance either! My talk isn't about compiler optimisation, multithreading, profilers, buffer management or cyclomatic complexity. In fact, what I’ve found is that optimising code doesn’t need to be more complicated than good old fashioned refactoring. Using a real problem that I encountered, my talk will take you through how I made slow code fast. Oh, and bunnies. Lots and lots of bunnies.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/greybaker">Grey Baker</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How buggy / insecure are new gem releases? Analysis of 10 years of Rubysec data and 50,000 dependency updates PRs.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="logic-programming-with-ruby-and-z3">Logic Programming with Ruby and Z3 <a href="#logic-programming-with-ruby-and-z3" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/t_a_w">Tomasz Wegrzanowski</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A lot of real problems can be described by a collection of mathematical equations. From sudoku to dependency resolution to verifying correctness of processors and cryptographic protocols.
<a href="https://github.com/taw/z3">Z3</a> is a very powerful solver for such problems, and an elegant Ruby DSL is a great interface to it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We should be done with the talks by 8pm, but there's bound to be plenty
to talk about after these so if you want to chat to your fellow attendees or
the speakers afterwards you have a couple of choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code Node</a>.  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y
1AG</a>).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
while the evening away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut">code of
conduct</a> even though it does seem more
informal.</p>

<p>Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.</p>

<h2 id="aug18registration">Venue &amp; Registration <a href="#aug18registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
<a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a> paying close attention to <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">the code of
conduct</a> which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.</p>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/11248-lrug-london-ruby-user-group">register with our hosts
Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/11248-lrug-london-ruby-user-group">register with Skills
Matter</a>.</p>
