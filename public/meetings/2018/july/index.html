  <p>The July 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Monday the 9th of July</em>,
from <em>6:00pm</em> to <em>8:00pm</em> (talks start at <em>6:30pm</em>).  The venue, <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code

<h2 id="agenda">Agenda <a href="#agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Our July meeting has three fantastic talks:</p>

<h2 id="write-better-tests-with-property-based-testing">Write better tests with property based testing <a href="#write-better-tests-with-property-based-testing" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/suzyhamilton">Suzanne Hamilton</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We write automated tests to give us confidence in our code, but bugs still
fall between the cracks. In this talk I'll show you how to apply the
techniques of property-based testing to use randomly-generated data to drive
out more bugs with fewer tests. I'll demonstrate these techniques using the
new Hypothesis for Ruby library which is based on the popular Hypothesis
Python library.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="css-shapes-upgrade-your-page-layouts">CSS Shapes: upgrade your page layouts <a href="#css-shapes-upgrade-your-page-layouts" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/knotnicky">Nicky Thompson</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Web design is getting boring. We're not learning enough from our history, and
so we're doomed to repeat our mistakes. You won't get your message across
effectively if your website looks like all the other websites out there.</p>

  <p>This talk will cover some of that history in an attempt to help us all learn
from it. You'll also learn some cool new ways CSS can help you stand out,
after which you will be armed with practical help to use these techniques,
the knowledge of when to use them (and when not to), and arguments to help
convince your colleagues of your great new ideas.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/ewanslater">Ewan Slater</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this talk I'll be covering:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>What is FaaS</li>
    <li>The Fn project - an open source agnostic FaaS platform</li>
    <li>The Ruby FDK (Function Development Kit)</li>
    <li>With a bit of inspiration from William Shakespeare.</li>
  </ul>

<h3 id="food-and-drinks">Food and Drinks <a href="#food-and-drinks" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>The nice people at <a href="https://www.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a> are sponsoring this
meeting by making some pizza and drinks available.  These will be made available
before the meeting downstairs in the Skills Matter bar area.  There should be
pizza suitable for vegetarian, vegan, and gluten-free diets and the drinks will
be the full range from the Skills Matter bar, including alcoholic and soft
options.</p>

<p>Thanks, <a href="https://www.thoughtbot.com/">thoughtbot</a>, for supporting us!</p>

<h2 id="afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>The talks will have finished by 8pm.  After that, though, youâ€™ll probably have
loads to talk about.  If you'd like to chat to the speakers or other attendees
about the talks, or anything else Ruby-adjacent, you have the following
choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code Node</a>.  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y
1AG</a>).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
while the evening away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Please remember that our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut">code of
conduct</a> still applies to this more
informal part of the meeting.</p>

<p>Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.</p>

<h2 id="jul18registration">Venue &amp; Registration <a href="#jul18registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
<a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a> paying close attention to <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">the code of
conduct</a> which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.</p>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/11180-lrug-july">register with our hosts
Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/11180-lrug-july">register with Skills
Matter</a>.</p>
