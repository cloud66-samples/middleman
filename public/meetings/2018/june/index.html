<h2 id="agenda">Agenda <a href="#agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Our June meeting has two talks and a prize draw!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-grow-a-small-development-team">How to grow a small development team <a href="#how-to-grow-a-small-development-team" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alinajaf">Najaf Ali</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This talk is about how we grew the team at Happy Bear Software. In this talk
I'll discuss:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>How working at a given company fits into a developer's career</li>
    <li>Finding candidates</li>
    <li>Selection</li>
    <li>On-boarding</li>
    <li>Retention</li>
    <li>What to do when people leave your team</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Much of how we hire is specific to our business and our goals, but there will
hopefully be two or three techniques, practices, or principles that you can
apply to your hiring process.</p>

<h2 id="breaking-into-computers-over-the-internet">Breaking into computers over the Internet <a href="#breaking-into-computers-over-the-internet" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/jalada">David Somers</a> wants to tell us how to protect the software you build:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ll start by talking briefly about the protocols computers use to
communicate. Then I'll discuss how they can be abused by demoing some of the
tools and techniques security professionals (and hackers) use to scan and
infiltrate servers. If the demo gods are on my side, I’ll break in to a
vulnerable system or two to show you how easy it is for people to exploit
known vulnerabilities in software you, as a software developer, may be
responsible for keeping up to date. Then finally I'll cover some ways to
protect the software you write from those types of attacks.</p>

<p>The kind people at <a href="https://www.streetbees.com/careers">Streetbees</a>, an
Artificial Intelligence based Market Research platform bolstered by powerful
community building tools, have bought us a couple of tickets to <a href="https://brightonruby.com">the Brighton
Ruby conference</a> on Friday, 6th July 2018.  We'll be
running a prize draw at this meeting; if you attend on the night your name will
be entered in the giveaway and the winning names will be drawn from a
hat<sup><a href="#brtp-hat">*</a></sup>.</p>

<p>Thanks <a href="https://www.streetbees.com/careers">streetbees</a>!</p>

<h2 id="afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Our talks will finish by 8pm, but that doesn't have to be the end of the evening
for you.  If you'd like to talk to the speakers, or to other attendees about the
talks, or other goings on in the ruby community you have a couple of options:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code Node</a>.  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y
1AG</a>).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
while the evening away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut">code of
conduct</a> even though it does seem more
informal.</p>

<p>Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.</p>

<h2 id="jun18registration">Venue &amp; Registration <a href="#jun18registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
<a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a> paying close attention to <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">the code of
conduct</a> which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.</p>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/11010-lrug-june">register with our hosts
Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/11010-lrug-june">register with Skills
Matter</a>.</p>
