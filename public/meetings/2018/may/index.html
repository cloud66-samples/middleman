  <p>The May 2018 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Wednesday the 9th of May</em>,
from <em>6:00pm</em> to <em>8:00pm</em> (talks start at <em>6:30pm</em>).  The venue, <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code
Node</a> between Moorgate and Liverpool St. stations, is
provided by <a href="http://www.skillsmatter.com">Skills Matter</a>.  <a href="#may18registration">Full venue and

<h2 id="agenda">Agenda <a href="#agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We've got three great talks for you in May:</p>

<h2 id="software-development--a-view-from-the-boardroom">Software Development – a view from the Boardroom <a href="#software-development--a-view-from-the-boardroom" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/alanbuxton">Alan Buxton</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Chances are you are building software for a business to use or sell, or both.
It’s likely that there is a board of directors involved making decisions that
affect you and your software. This talk aims to give you a personal insight
into what it’s like to be a CTO on a startup’s board in the hope that it
gives you another perspective on ‘the business’ and helps you become a more
rounded developer.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="an-introduction-to-event-sourcing">An Introduction to Event Sourcing <a href="#an-introduction-to-event-sourcing" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mottalrd">Alfredo Motta</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html">Event sourcing</a> is a recently
developed design pattern to build applications that are domain centric and easy to
extend. The pattern is based on the usage of a persistent event log which 
substitutes the more classical relational database model for Rails applications.
Such event log can then be used for extending your application in all sort of 
creative ways. For example, by synchronizing data between your microservices, 
trigger side effects without cluttering your models or controllers, or build data
views optimized for your query needs. In this talk, I'll present the basic ideas, 
some of the tradeoffs and challenges you might find and how you could start 
experimenting with it.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="on-writing--code-">On Writing &lt;%= code %&gt; <a href="#on-writing--code-" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/elliotthilaire">Elliot Hilaire</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Writing code in high-level programming languages began in the 1950s. In contrast, 
writing goes back more than 5000 years. So, what can we learn from people who
study writing? This talk explores concepts from three books about writing and 
applies them to coding.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="afterwards">Afterwards <a href="#afterwards" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We should be done with the talks by 8pm, but there's bound to be plenty
to talk about after these so if you want to chat to your fellow attendees or
the speakers afterwards you have a couple of choices:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://skillsmatter.com/locations/264-skills-matter-codenode">Code Node</a>.  Skills Matter run a bar with a choice of
drinks (hard and soft) available.  As well as other LRUG members you can
network with attendees of the other meetups that Skills Matter are hosing on
the same night.</li>
  <li><a href="http://singertavern.com/">The Singer Tavern</a>.  This bar is a short walk
north from Code Node (you can find it at <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/w9kPu">1 City Road, EC1Y
1AG</a>).  This pub has a decent food menu on offer
as well as a selection of drinks and other LRUG attendees to help you
while the evening away.</li>
</ol>

<p>Regardless of what you choose to do, please remember that this part of the
meeting is still covered by our <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-condut">code of
conduct</a> even though it does seem more
informal.</p>

<p>Don't worry that you'll miss out on this part if you can't make the talks.
Attendance of the talks is far from mandatory to attend the socialising
afterwards, so please do come along anyway if you can.</p>

<h2 id="may18registration">Venue &amp; Registration <a href="#may18registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Prior to attending you should familiarise yourself with our
<a href="http://readme.lrug.org/">README</a> paying close attention to <a href="http://readme.lrug.org/#code-of-conduct">the code of
conduct</a> which applies to
all attendees at the talks and afterwards in the pub.</p>

<p>To secure a place at the meeting you <em>must</em> <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/10906-lrug-may">register with our hosts
Skills Matter</a>.  It helps to
make sure we have the room laid out with enough chairs, and in extreme cases
that we get priority on the larger rooms over other groups using the space on
the same night.  Also, it's good manners, so please do <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/meetups/10906-lrug-may">register with Skills
Matter</a>.</p>
