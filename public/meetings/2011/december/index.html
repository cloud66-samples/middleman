<p>If you use, write, or maintain APIs for your web applications, you'll love our line-up this month; December is API month!</p>

<h3 id="mark-burns-hateoas">Mark Burns: HATEOAS <a href="#mark-burns-hateoas" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/_mark_burns">Mark Burns</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've been trying to understand the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> constraint myself. 
<a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/tag/rest">Roy Fielding's blog posts</a> are almost indecipherable to an 
ordinary developer like me. I think there's a huge gap in relevant easily accessible information on 
understanding it, and how to implement it, what it's benefits are etc.</p>

  <p>One of the aspects that I've found particularly confusing is the concept of not having out-of-band 
communication and having discoverable APIs.</p>

  <p>In <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">one particular blog post</a> Roy says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of 
standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be 
understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state 
transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in 
the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. 
The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and 
resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand).
[Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I'd like to talk about how this limitation on out-of-band information seems both insane and 
impractical, maybe impossible. But then I may go on to explore how actually it makes some 
form of sense. And how you can use this knowledge to write APIs that are easier to code to, 
and whilst not resilient to change in some magical sense, it should allow you to write clients
that are easier to adapt and update.</p>

<h3 id="javier-ramirez-usable-apis">Javier Ramirez: Usable APIs <a href="#javier-ramirez-usable-apis" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/supercoco9">Javier Ramirez</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the adoption of REST, the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, and the second coming 
of JavaScript, exposing our applications as a service is now more important than ever.</p>

  <p>Rails or Sinatra make really easy to create a (kinda) RESTful API but, in many occassions, 
these APIs are designed without really thinking on the developers that will have to use them.</p>

  <p>I want to talk about some of the points that can help making your API more developer-friendly. 
Some of the areas I'll cover will be discoverability, authentication, headers, formats, parameters, 
documentation and tools.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="pub">Pub <a href="#pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We usually finish the talks at around 8pm and head over to <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> to chat about the talks, or whatever comes to mind, over a beer and a fish-finger sandwich.  Sometimes you can't make it to the main event, that's not a problem though, just come along to the pub and you'll be welcomed with open arms.  Especially if you get there a bit before 8pm and secure me a table.</p>

<h2 id="dec11registration">Registration <a href="#dec11registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Skills Matter prefer that you <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/ruby-apis/js-3123">register your attendance with them</a> if you are coming to the meeting.  There's plenty of space so you'll get in if you forget, but it is polite (don't forget <a href="http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036">MINASWAN</a>), so please do <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event-details/home/ruby-apis/js-3123">register</a>.</p>

<p>You can also follow <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-december/">this meeting on lanyrd</a>, but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?</p>
