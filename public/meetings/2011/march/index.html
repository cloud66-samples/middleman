<h3 id="james-coglan-primer">James Coglan: Primer <a href="#james-coglan-primer" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://jcoglan.com/">James Coglan</a> is going to talk to us about <a href="https://github.com/jcoglan/primer">Primer</a> his caching system for rails:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's no secret that expiring caches is hard. But it's also tedious, error-prone,
and it forces a lot of duplication as your sweeper code is tightly coupled to
how your views work. And caching itself introduces complexity: by caching data,
you're creating multiple ways to compute the same value.</p>

  <p>What if we could get rid of all this? I'm going to take a look at Primer, a Rails
extension I've been working on that means you'll never write another cache sweeper.
With a handful of mixins, you can keep writing your views the way you like and
Primer will deal with keeping them snappy. You'll see how you can use ActiveRecord's
reflections to automate a lot of caching work, how to regenerate your views offline
using worker processes, and how to add real-time updates to your pages, all with
code you could write during your coffee break.</p>

<p>Also known as: "end to end is harder than you think". <a href="http://chrismdp.github.com/">Chris Parsons</a> describes this talk as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this talk Chris will take us through how he test-drove the development of a
command line utility built as a gem, designed to connect to servers
via SSH and HTTP. We'll discuss the use of <a href="https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/aruba">Aruba</a> for command line
testing in cucumber, how to deal with external connections, and how to
discover your service interfaces as you build the client.</p>

<h2 id="pub">Pub <a href="#pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>After all this we'll head to <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> to while away the rest of the evening in more informal settings.  The pub is only a five minute walk from Skills Matter's offices and we'll be there from about 8pm onwards. If you're unable to make it on time for the main meeting then feel free to join us for the pub-bit.</p>

<h2 id="mar11registration">Registration <a href="#mar11registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Skills Matter prefer that you <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/primer-and-lessons-learned-bdd-ing-a-command-line-utility-gem/rl-311">register your attendance with them</a> if you are coming to the meeting.  On a few exceptional occasions we've had to turn away people who haven't registered, but this has only been at extremely popular meetings, and has yet to happen at the new venue on Goswell Road.  It's better to be safe than sorry though, and it is polite (don't forget <a href="http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036">MINASWAN</a>), so please do <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/primer-and-lessons-learned-bdd-ing-a-command-line-utility-gem/rl-311">register</a>.</p>

<p>You can also follow <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-mar-2011/">this meeting on lanyrd</a>, but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?</p>
