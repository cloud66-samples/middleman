  <p>The December 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Monday</em> the 12th of December, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.  Our hosts <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> will be providing the space, at their offices on Goswell Road; <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/design-architecture/484/96">The Skills Matter eXchange</a>.  It's a great space with plenty of room for the group, but you still need to <a href="#dec11registration">register to let Skills Matter know you are coming</a>.</p>

<h2 id="december-2011-meeting--agenda">Agenda <a href="#december-2011-meeting--agenda" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>If you use, write, or maintain APIs for your web applications, you'll love our line-up this month; December is API month!</p>

<h3 id="december-2011-meeting--mark-burns-hateoas">Mark Burns: HATEOAS <a href="#december-2011-meeting--mark-burns-hateoas" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/_mark_burns">Mark Burns</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've been trying to understand the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS">HATEOAS</a> constraint myself. 
<a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/tag/rest">Roy Fielding's blog posts</a> are almost indecipherable to an 
ordinary developer like me. I think there's a huge gap in relevant easily accessible information on 
understanding it, and how to implement it, what it's benefits are etc.</p>

  <p>One of the aspects that I've found particularly confusing is the concept of not having out-of-band 
communication and having discoverable APIs.</p>

  <p>In <a href="http://roy.gbiv.com/untangled/2008/rest-apis-must-be-hypertext-driven">one particular blog post</a> Roy says:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>A REST API should be entered with no prior knowledge beyond the initial URI (bookmark) and set of 
standardized media types that are appropriate for the intended audience (i.e., expected to be 
understood by any client that might use the API). From that point on, all application state 
transitions must be driven by client selection of server-provided choices that are present in 
the received representations or implied by the user’s manipulation of those representations. 
The transitions may be determined (or limited by) the client’s knowledge of media types and 
resource communication mechanisms, both of which may be improved on-the-fly (e.g., code-on-demand).
[Failure here implies that out-of-band information is driving interaction instead of hypertext.]</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>I'd like to talk about how this limitation on out-of-band information seems both insane and 
impractical, maybe impossible. But then I may go on to explore how actually it makes some 
form of sense. And how you can use this knowledge to write APIs that are easier to code to, 
and whilst not resilient to change in some magical sense, it should allow you to write clients
that are easier to adapt and update.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/supercoco9">Javier Ramirez</a> says:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>With the adoption of REST, the proliferation of smartphones and tablets, and the second coming 
of JavaScript, exposing our applications as a service is now more important than ever.</p>

  <p>Rails or Sinatra make really easy to create a (kinda) RESTful API but, in many occassions, 
these APIs are designed without really thinking on the developers that will have to use them.</p>

  <p>I want to talk about some of the points that can help making your API more developer-friendly. 
Some of the areas I'll cover will be discoverability, authentication, headers, formats, parameters, 
documentation and tools.</p>

<h2 id="december-2011-meeting--pub">Pub <a href="#december-2011-meeting--pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We usually finish the talks at around 8pm and head over to <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> to chat about the talks, or whatever comes to mind, over a beer and a fish-finger sandwich.  Sometimes you can't make it to the main event, that's not a problem though, just come along to the pub and you'll be welcomed with open arms.  Especially if you get there a bit before 8pm and secure me a table.</p>

<p><a href="http://aanandprasad.com/">Aanand</a> has some Ruby code to show you. It looks a little strange - in fact, it doesn't even look valid.</p>

<pre><code>Array.run do
  x &lt;- ["first", "second"]
  y &lt;- ["once", "twice"]

  ["#{x} cousin #{y} removed"]
end
</code></pre>

<p>What does it do, and how does it do it? If you know what a macro is, or a continuation, or a monad, you might be able to guess. If not, don't worry - by the end, you'll probably be as confused as everyone else, including the speaker.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/abdels">Abdel</a> wants to tell us about his experiences of developing an iOS app from a Rubyists perspective:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have been ducking Objective-C at every turn for a very long time. Who wants to learn a heavily typed static behemoth just to write an iPhone app?!</p>

  <p>So, I did what every self respecting programmer would do, throw alternative open solutions aka Javascript frameworks at the problem.</p>

  <p>But in the end I had to succumb to the will of the Almighty Apple - I needed their Objective C to make stuff happen … and it wasn't that bad :)</p>

  <p>This is all the learning, similarities (of which there are a few) and differences between Objective-C and Ruby.</p>

<p><a href="http://po-ru.com/">Paul Battley</a> has written <a href="https://github.com/threedaymonk/battleship">a game engine based on the game of battleships</a> and will be letting us play with it.  <em>Before the meeting</em> you should write a player for Paul's game engine and during the meeting we'll pit the players against each other in a tournament.  Once the winner is declared we'll look at the player implementations and get their authors to talk about them.  In case you win you should be prepared to show off your code and discuss the strategy you implemented.</p>

<p>There is more information available on the <a href="http://lists.lrug.org/pipermail/chat-lrug.org/2011-September/006352.html">mailing list thread where Paul announced the event</a>.  If you have any questions <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> is the place to ask them.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A talk about caching, chef, munin, load testing and hosting. As part of its adoption of agile
techniques and its creation of a Skunkworks division, <a href="http://direct.gov.uk">DirectGov</a> asked the <a href="http://www.agiledelivery.net/">Agile Delivery Network</a>
to build a successor website to the Number 10 e-petitions site with a 6 week deadline. The talk
aims to highlight the measures taken to cope with high throughput, what worked and what could be
done differently to avoid headlines like <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/politics/2011/aug/04/government-e-petition-website-crashes">"Government's e-petition website crashes on first day"</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://mudge.name">Paul Mucur</a> describes his talk as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Joshua Sierles of 37signals once described configuration management as
something that <a href="http://37signals.com/svn/posts/1872-nuts-bolts-configuration-management-with-chef">"doesn't sound sexy, but it's the single most important
thing we do as sysadmins"</a>
but what is it and what do tools like
Chef and Puppet offer from the point of view of a developer?</p>

  <p>In this presentation I want to talk about how configuration management
allowed me – a developer with no access to the live servers and
working with system administrators in a different time zone – to not
only install and configure servers quickly and in a repeatable way but
also let me be confident about the consistency of each and every
machine I deploy to.</p>

  <p>Using the example of getting a server ready to run a Rails application
using <a href="http://www.puppetlabs.com/">Puppet</a> (and testing things out with the aid of <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a>), I will
showcase some patterns that we have developed for managing versions of
Ruby with RVM, the installation of Phusion Passenger and how to deploy
a database.yml when you're not allowed to see live passwords.</p>

<p><a href="http://morethanseven.net/">Gareth Rushgrove</a> is a sometimes Ruby programmer and occasional sysadmin. He curates the <a href="http://devopsweekly.com/">devopsweekly mailing list</a>, lives in Cambridge and writes code for fun and profit.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most developers spend far too much time managing a development
environment that is different to the one they use for production
applications. Different tools, different underlying libraries and
different bugs. Local virtualisation provides an answer, but
historically it's been time consuming and annoying to setup and
manage. Using configuration management tools like <a href="http://www.opscode.com/chef/">Chef</a> to set things
up, and <a href="http://vagrantup.com/">Vagrant</a> to easily manage the virtual machines
from the command line provides modern developers the best of all
possible worlds.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.andrewmcdonough.com/">Andrew McDonough</a> is going to lead a practical evening called "Ruby Golf".  He describes it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I started my career as a perl programmer.  Perl, like
ruby has a lot of 'syntactic sugar' to help developers write concise
code.  Perl programmers sometimes play a game known as '<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?PerlGolf">Perl Golf</a>' to
explore the lesser-known features of the language.  The aim of 'perl
golf' is to solve a problem using the fewest characters possible.</p>

  <p>At this month's meeting Andrew will run a practical evening based
around 'ruby golf', an adaptation of perl golf for ruby developers.
People will be asked to form teams of 4-8 people, and solve nine short
ruby golf 'holes' using as few characters as possible.  Each hole will
be defined by a set of <a href="http://rspec.info">RSpec</a> examples describing a single method, and
the teams must write the method to pass all of the examples.  At the
end, the solutions will be scored and the winning team will be
announced.</p>

  <p>This evening should have something for everyone; beginners can pick up
some language tricks and learn how to write code to pass tests, while
experienced ruby developers will have the opportunity to show off
their skills and compete with their peers.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: This is going to be a full evening of practical activity.  We'll break up into small groups on the night to go through what Andrew has prepared.  You should bring your laptop so you can play along.  Don't worry if you don't know anyone, there will be plenty of groups to join in on the night.  Also, you should sign up to the <a href="/mailing-list">mailing list</a> to find out about any further instructions.</p>

We normally finish up the meetings at around 8pm, and are in the bar by 8:05pm.

<p><a href="http://benscofield.com/">Ben Scofield</a> from <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is visiting us on his way home from the <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish Ruby Conference</a> and has kindly volunteered to give us the following talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year ago, I was a committed VPS and dedicated-machine deployer. I thought the cloud
imposed silly restrictions - how dare you take away my shell account! Whaddya mean I
can't save files locally?</p>

  <p>Since then, I've had some interesting experiences. I've worked on big cloud-deployed
systems, and certain large traditionally-deployed systems, and I've seen how a lot of
the decisions that you're … encouraged to make when designing an app to run in the
cloud. Most interestingly, I've discovered how those same decisions can make for a
much better app regardless of where it'll end up. In this talk, I'll share those
architectural patterns with you, and show why they work. Hopefully, I'll convince all
of you to build cloud castles – even if you've got your foundation firmly on the
ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: Ben is talking at <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/sessions">SRC</a> but it's not the same talk that he's giving to us, so if you are going to SRC don't miss his talk thinking you'll catch it at LRUG when you get home.</p>

  <p>The March 2011 meeting of LRUG will be on <em>Monday</em> the 7th of March, from 6:30pm to 8:00pm.

<p><a href="http://jcoglan.com/">James Coglan</a> is going to talk to us about <a href="https://github.com/jcoglan/primer">Primer</a> his caching system for rails:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's no secret that expiring caches is hard. But it's also tedious, error-prone,
and it forces a lot of duplication as your sweeper code is tightly coupled to
how your views work. And caching itself introduces complexity: by caching data,
you're creating multiple ways to compute the same value.</p>

  <p>What if we could get rid of all this? I'm going to take a look at Primer, a Rails
extension I've been working on that means you'll never write another cache sweeper.
With a handful of mixins, you can keep writing your views the way you like and
Primer will deal with keeping them snappy. You'll see how you can use ActiveRecord's
reflections to automate a lot of caching work, how to regenerate your views offline
using worker processes, and how to add real-time updates to your pages, all with
code you could write during your coffee break.</p>

<p>Also known as: "end to end is harder than you think". <a href="http://chrismdp.github.com/">Chris Parsons</a> describes this talk as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this talk Chris will take us through how he test-drove the development of a
command line utility built as a gem, designed to connect to servers
via SSH and HTTP. We'll discuss the use of <a href="https://github.com/aslakhellesoy/aruba">Aruba</a> for command line
testing in cucumber, how to deal with external connections, and how to
discover your service interfaces as you build the client.</p>

<h3 id="february-2011-meeting--lightning-talks">Lightning talks! <a href="#february-2011-meeting--lightning-talks" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p>It's February, so this means it's time for our annual lightning talk evening.  This means lots of short talks all in one night.  Because that's not quite fun enough, we use the 20x20 format for the talks.  This means each speaker has 20 slides that auto-transition after 20 seconds, giving them 6 minutes 40 seconds to get their point across.  It's a fun format for a talk, as the rigid time constraints mean the speakers have to choose between explaining their opinions in detail (and missing out something else) or stating them as fact.  This is especially fun when the opinions are controversial.</p>

<p>The brave 20x20ers for 2011 are (in alphabetical order, on the night the talks will be randomised):</p>

<p>These short talks are bound to raise more questions than they answer and to answer those questions we'll head over to <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a>.  It's only five minutes from Skills Matter's offices and does a killer fish-finger sandwich.  The talks will probably finish around 8pm, so if for some reason you aren't able to make it for the talks (but you really should try), head to the pub for about 8pm and you'll find blocking all reasonable access to the bar for about 20-30 minutes.  Maybe get there a bit earlier?</p>

He'll be telling us about some work at the BBC involving twitter:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'll be talking about how we're using Ruby to process tweets in
realtime to discover inbound links to the <a href="http://zeitgeist.prototyping.bbc.co.uk/zeitgeist">BBC Zeitgeist</a>
and how we're reading the <a href="http://dev.twitter.com/pages/streaming_api">Twitter Firehose</a> (about 1000 tweets/sec =
about 90 million a day) and storing the data in Amazon S3.</p>

  <p>There'll be a bit about <a href="http://hadoop.apache.org/">Hadoop</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_reduce">Map/Reduce</a> too.</p>

<p><a href="http://matthewrudy.com/">Matthew</a> has been living it up in Hong Kong for the past year and will be making a brief stop at our humble meeting to explain some of the work he's been doing there in building a financial application.

<p>At the start of the meetings, and during laptop faffing between talks we leave the floor open for the audience.  The idea is that if there's something you want to say to the group (announce you're team is hiring, let people know about a new gem you've written, point out a new conference, ask for help on a personal project, whatever really…) then this is the time to do it.  Just keep it short, if it's longer than a minute, maybe you should think about <a href="/speaking/">doing a longer talk</a>.</p>

<p>We'll see in the New Year after the meeting with a couple of drinks at <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> which is only a five minute walk from Skills Matter's offices.  We aim to finish the meeting at around 8pm, so if you can't make the more formal part of the evening head to the pub then and you'll find us nattering over a pint.</p>
