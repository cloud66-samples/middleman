<p><a href="http://benscofield.com/">Ben Scofield</a> from <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> is visiting us on his way home from the <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/">Scottish Ruby Conference</a> and has kindly volunteered to give us the following talk:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A year ago, I was a committed VPS and dedicated-machine deployer. I thought the cloud
imposed silly restrictions - how dare you take away my shell account! Whaddya mean I
can't save files locally?</p>

  <p>Since then, I've had some interesting experiences. I've worked on big cloud-deployed
systems, and certain large traditionally-deployed systems, and I've seen how a lot of
the decisions that you're … encouraged to make when designing an app to run in the
cloud. Most interestingly, I've discovered how those same decisions can make for a
much better app regardless of where it'll end up. In this talk, I'll share those
architectural patterns with you, and show why they work. Hopefully, I'll convince all
of you to build cloud castles – even if you've got your foundation firmly on the
ground.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Note: Ben is talking at <a href="http://scottishrubyconference.com/sessions">SRC</a> but it's not the same talk that he's giving to us, so if you are going to SRC don't miss his talk thinking you'll catch it at LRUG when you get home.</p>

<p><a href="http://jabberwocky.eu/">Elise Huard</a> is going to give us a talk about:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A brief overview of the state of concurrency in Ruby, concurrency models
used in other languages, and why actors might be the way to go.</p>

<p>After all this we'll head to <a href="http://www.theslaughteredlambpub.com/">The Slaughtered Lamb</a> to while away the rest of the evening in more informal settings.  The pub is only a five minute walk from Skills Matter's offices and we'll be there from about 8pm onwards. If you're unable to make it on time for the main meeting then feel free to join us for the pub-bit.</p>

<h2 id="apr11registration">Registration <a href="#apr11registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>Skills Matter prefer that you <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/building-cloud-castles/js-1540">register your attendance with them</a> if you are coming to the meeting.  On a few exceptional occasions we've had to turn away people who haven't registered, but this has only been at extremely popular meetings, and has yet to happen at the new venue on Goswell Road.  It's better to be safe than sorry though, and it is polite (don't forget <a href="http://oreilly.com/ruby/excerpts/ruby-learning-rails/ruby-glossary.html#I_indexterm_d1e32036">MINASWAN</a>), so please do <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/building-cloud-castles/js-1540">register</a>.</p>

<p>You can also follow <a href="http://lanyrd.com/2011/lrug-apr/">this meeting on lanyrd</a>, but be aware this is not a meaningful way to tell Skills Matter you wish to attending.  It's just for the lols, innit?</p>
