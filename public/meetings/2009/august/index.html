As usual our hosts <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> will provide the space, at our new venue <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/location-details/home/166/26">The Crypt</a> (it's very close to the other venues).

<p><a href="http://www.taryneast.com/">Taryn East</a> wants to talk to us about profiling.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I've used the <a href="http://ruby-prof.rubyforge.org/">ruby-prof</a> and
<a href="http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/Home.html">kcachegrind</a> tools a few
times to profile some of the rails projects I've worked on. They're powerful
tools that can let you dig down into the bowels of your code and find the
real trouble-makers, but they require a bit of familiarity as they really
are a bit of information-overload. So I thought I could give a talk on
how to set them up - where/how to use them and what they can do for you.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A video of Taryn's talk is available on the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/making-your-rails-app-kick-ass-with-ruby-prof-and-kcachegrind">Skills Matter site</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.sho.ch/">Alex Graul</a> is going to talk about AMQP messaging with ruby.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://amqp.org">AMQP</a> is a powerful, flexible and completely open messaging standard. Capable of
scaling to millions of messages a second with incredibly low latency, AMQP is an
fantastic backbone on which to build service architectures. In this talk I'll give
you an overview of the AMQP standard, an introduction to synchronous and asynchronous
libraries for working with AMQP in Ruby and some examples uses.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If he's finished writing it, <a href="http://www.gerhardlazu.com/">Gerhard Lazu</a> will do a demo of a app for buffering <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHOUTcast">ICY streams</a> using AMQP.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/mortenheroku">Morten Bagai</a> from <a href="http://heroku.com/">Heroku</a> might be in town and if so is going to give us an overview of their platform.  His presentation will also cover where they're going in the near future, what they'd like to know from us and info on their plans for their European customers.</p>

<p><del>Stealing</del><ins>Borrowing</ins> an idea from the <a href="http://rubyonrails.com.au/sydney-meetups">Sydney Ruby User Group</a> we'll put aside some time at the start of the meeting where you can pass on information you think is of interest to the group.  For example you could announce a new gem you've written or found useful recently, let people know about any interesting events that are happening soon or just bring people's attention to news or gossip within the greater ruby community.  If you'd think about blogging it or starring it in your RSS reader, then mention it here.  This section will last for about 10-15 minutes and anyone can speak if they keep it short and to the point!</p>

<p>At the end of the formal part of the meeting we change into our smoking jackets and retire to the quiet backrooms of a local tavern for a snifter of brandy, a fine snub of tobacco for our pipes and try to outdo each other with increasingly outrageous anecdotes.  <a href="http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html">The Crown Tavern</a> is just down the street from the venue for the talks and is ideally located for this after-hours debating session.  Those of us unable to make the main meeting should aim to arrive at The Crown Tavern at about 8pm if they want to join in the debate.</p>

<h2 id="aug09registration">Registration <a href="#aug09registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>We need people to <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-aug">register with Skills Matter</a> if they are planning on attending.  Registration lets Skills Matter know how many people to expect to turn up and plan the venue accordingly.  There shouldn't be any capacity problems with the new venue, but you should still <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-aug">register as early as you can</a> to help them out.</p>

<p>There's also an <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/3071748/">upcoming event</a> for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.</p>
