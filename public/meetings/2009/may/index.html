<h3 id="ruby-ffi">Ruby FFI <a href="#ruby-ffi" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://seanohalpin.github.com/">Sean O'Halpin</a> will be talking about <a href="http://kenai.com/projects/ruby-ffi">Ruby FFI</a>, probably using his <a href="http://github.com/seanohalpin/ffi-ncurses/">FFI-ncurses</a> gem to provide some examples.</p>

<h3 id="treetop">Treetop <a href="#treetop" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://knaveofdiamonds.tumblr.com/">Roland Swingler</a> has been looking at <a href="http://treetop.rubyforge.org/">Treetop</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Regular expressions are great but they're unreadable when complex, and
there are some things they just can't do. The alternative is to build
a language parser - but that's really hard, isn't it? In this talk,
I'll try and dispell that idea and show how building little languages
in ruby is really simple. I'll show two examples: defining a
mini-language from scratch to build XMPP bots, and using it as part of
your screen-scraping toolbox.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A video of Roland's talk is available on the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/treetop">Skills Matter site</a>.</p>

<h3 id="scheme">Scheme <a href="#scheme" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h3>

<p><a href="http://blog.jcoglan.com/">James Coglan</a> is writing a <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/stickup">Scheme interpreter in Ruby</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/projects/scheme/">Scheme</a> is a member 
of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_programming_language">Lisp</a> 
family of languages, and is an excellent place to start if you're 
interested in writing your own language. It's small and simple to parse, 
yet has several advanced features that are only now becoming mainstream. 
Based on <a href="http://github.com/jcoglan/heist/">Heist</a>, my main interpreter
project, I present a brief overview of Scheme and use
<a href="http://treetop.rubyforge.org/">Treetop</a> to create a small runtime that 
includes booleans, integer arithmetic, variables, user-defined functions,
conditionals, recursion and lexical closures.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A video of James' talk is available on the <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/podcast/ajax-ria/implementing-scheme-in-ruby">Skills Matter site</a>.</p>

<h2 id="pub">Pub <a href="#pub" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>It's tradition at LRUG to head to the local pub after the talks to relax and chat with other rubyists.  We go to <a href="http://fancyapint.com/pubs/pub199.html">The Crown Tavern</a> which is a short walk from either of the venues Skills Matter provides.  If you can't make the main meeting you'll find plenty of rubyists propping up the bar from about 8:00pm onwards after the talks.  Come along!</p>

<h2 id="may09registration">Registration <a href="#may09registration" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p><a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-may">Please register with Skills Matter</a> if you are planning to come (or even just thinking about it).  Please register as early as you can.  In fact, <a href="http://skillsmatter.com/event/ajax-ria/lrug-may">go and do it now</a>!  The reason for this is that if a lot of folk want to come we obviously need a larger room and Skills Matter need about a week's notice to book it.  They'll only do so if the registrations dictate it.  If you register late they might not have enough time to book a larger room and you might get put on a waiting list or simply turned away.  We don't want that!</p>

<p>There's also an <a href="http://upcoming.yahoo.com/event/2128116/">upcoming event</a> for those of us that love online calendaring, but this is not a place to indicate attendance in a meaningful way for Skills Matter.</p>
