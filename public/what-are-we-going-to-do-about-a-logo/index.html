              <h1>What Are We Going To Do About A Logo?</h1>
  <p>In April 2008 the <a href="/members-and-friends/">LRUG members</a> decided to end their days wandering in the logo-less desert and choose an official LRUG logo.  Until this point LRUG didn't have an official logo, and whilst it wasn't really hurting the group, occasionally people we were involved with would ask for one and all we could do was look at our shoes, shuffle our feet and say "uh, we don't really have one".  To avoid embarrassment in the future when asked similar questions, we decided to finally settle the matter once and for all and come up with one.</p>

<p>Using <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> we had a short call for submissions followed by a vote to choose which one of those would be the winner.</p>

<h2 id="the-winner">The Winner <a href="#the-winner" class="heading-anchor" aria-hidden="true">#</a></h2>

<p>"El Rug" by Andrew McDonough</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the end of the story, we now need someone to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>vectorise this image so it can be scaled properly</li>
  <li>essentially re-draw it so it's less obviously copyright theft.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you think you have the skills to help out with this, please get in touch with <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#117;&#114;&#114;&#097;&#121;&#046;&#115;&#116;&#101;&#101;&#108;&#101;&#064;&#103;&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">me</a> or <a href="/mailing-list">the mailing list</a> and we can finish the job.</p>

    <p><img src="https://assets.lrug.org/images/logos/james_adam/lrug-logo.gif" alt="The original" />
The original logo, done as a joke, but it's the closest to an official logo as it was used at the 
<a href="http://lrug.org/meetings/2006/12/07/january-2007-pub-quiz-meeting/">LRUG pub quiz</a> 
and on the flyer for the <a href="http://lrug.org/meetings/2006/09/08/lrug-railsconf-party/">LRUG RailsConf London party</a>.
Most other logos have used the basic idea as inspiration (e.g. a London skyline inside a Ruby gem).</p>

Actually a tweak of one of Paul Battley's logos shown below.  Also blessed with a modicum of official-ness as it's 
currently in use on the <a href="http://www.workingwithrails.com/group/3831-london-ruby-users-group">LRUG WWR page</a>.</p>

Richard attempted to redesign the LRUG site and this logo was his attempt to bring LRUG closer to the then current Ruby logo.
This logo is another with a smell of official-ness wafting around it as it's currently in use as the Logo on the

<a href="http://skillsmatter.com/">Skills Matter</a> are our hosts for our <a href="/meetings">meetings</a> and they offered 
us this logo and this has sparked the debate once again.</li>

  <li><img src="https://assets.lrug.org/images/logos/murray_steele/lrug_nights.png" alt="Based on the Baywatch Nights logo" />
We have a <a href="/nights/">spin-off meeting</a>, which has it's own logo.  Can the main group logo reflect this 
logo somehow, so that in some sort of bizarre reversal of the natural order of things the spin-off 
influences the mainstream? (Also <a href="https://assets.lrug.org/images/lrug-nights.svg">available in SVG</a>).</li>

Of course, London has more icons than just a skyline.  It's likely however TfL would destroy us in a 
legal sense if we used this.  However, can the basic idea of the TfL roundel be used to make something
less obviously derivative?</li>

  <li><img src="https://assets.lrug.org/images/logos/chris_parsons/elle-rug.jpg" alt="It's ironical" />
Jason Lee also submitted a similar idea, but he didn't collect it into a single image for hosting.  So I'm crediting Chris.</li>

  <li><img src="https://assets.lrug.org/images/logos/andrew_mcdonough/elrug.jpg" alt="It's what we're all thinking anyway" />
This is probably what normal people think when they hear LRUG pronounced.  James Adam
has altered this to create his own version, which you can see <a href="https://assets.lazyatom.com/elrug_hoho.jpg">here</a>, but we're giving 
the credit to Andrew McDonough for doing all the heavy lifting.</li>

  <li><img src="https://assets.lrug.org/images/logos/murray_steele/lrug-river.png" alt="A river runs through it" />
Based on thinking about what other icons London has (after Andrew Stewart's TfL inspired version), we have the Thames 
river.  The execution is poor, but there might be some merit to the idea in the hands of a more skilled <em>artiste</em>.
